Im here because if I get expelled from school, Ill have to sit around my moms apartment all day, and if I have to sit around my moms apartment  all day, Ill go even crazier than I am already, know what Im saying? So Ill sit here with you, but only if you ease off.</div><div class="tx">Thats perfectly all right, Bur</div><div class="tx">What, are you deaf or something? Didnt you hear me say dont call me that like ten times already? I go by Butterball, all right? Bu-tter-ball, I sounded it out. Its not that hard.</div><div class="tx">The woman nodded, tugging at a few strands that had come loose from her bun. It was impossible to tell how old she was. She could be thirty-five or fifty-five; I really had no clue. All right then. Do you mind if I ask how you feel about being called Butterball?</div><div class="tx">How do I <i>feel</i>? I laughed. Cmon, lady, this has to be a joke. How long am I supposed to sit here again? Is it forty-five minutes or an hour?</div><div class="tx">She pursed her lips together tightly. Our sessions run forty-five minutes, or as long as I feel is appropriate. And for the record, I dont answer to lady. You can call me Liz or Ms. Jenner, whichever you like, but those are your only options.</div><div class="tx">I laughed again. This woman was really cracking me up. Liz? Yeah, no, thanks, but no thanks.</div><div class="tx">Ahem<i>Butterball</i>. However you want to play this is fine with me. Im perfectly happy to go at your pace.</div><div class="tx">Great.</div><div class="tx">All right then.</div><div class="tx">She folded her arms in front of her and sat very still, staring right at me without speaking. I fixed my eyes on the ugly painting of three sailboats under a smeary blue sky that was hanging right above her head. What kind of fool would choose a picture like that? It had no detail, no point of view, no nothinglike a piece of art chosen as a movie prop to show the character in question has zero taste.</div><div class="tx">From downstairs, the fried-chicken smell kept getting stronger and stronger. And dont think I didnt see the way that therapist was staring at melike shed better lock up her valuables when Im around, not that this shitty office had anything worth half as much as my pair of sneakers.</div><div class="tx">Im not sure how many minutes passedthree, five, ten? But it looked like this white lady wasnt going to budge. Seemed like she might have even been as stubborn as my mom, and that was saying something. She just kept on sitting there staring at me, until finally I had no choice but to say, All right, fine. You can ask me questions, but I dont have to answer them. Hows that for a deal? <i>You crazy bitch</i>, I was too polite to add.</div><div class="tx">Well, I guess thats fine, then. I appreciate that.

The morning dragged on like it always did, but that day I had no trouble staying awake in geometry or social studies. I was pumped. I knew what I had to do, and I couldnt wait to do it. Not to get it over with, but to savor every last second of it. My sweet revenge.</div><div class="tx">At lunch I was too hopped up to eat, and anyone who knows me understands how janky that was. But no one noticed because no one at J. Watkins Junior High School gave a shit about my fat ass one way or another. That was about to change; I was sure of it.</div><div class="tx">After lunch the playground was more crowded than usual, and that suited my purposes fine. Hey, Maurice! I called out when I saw him sitting on the bench by the monkey bars. He was alone and had a book open in front of him, but that was pretty much how it went with Maurice. He had zero friendswhy would he?and spent all his free time reading.</div><div class="tx">When I said his name, Maurice looked up at me with a funny expression, almost like he knew what was about to happen. But I play fair, so I gave him a chance to defend himself. Hey, Maurice, I think its time you learned what happens when you talk shit about me, I said.</div><div class="tx">What do you mean, man? he asked with what might or might not have been a smile. It was always hard to figure out what Maurice was thinking, whether he was making fun of me or not. Well, he was about to stop laughing.</div><div class="tx">Hey, Maurice, I said again, and this time I was shouting, walking toward him a little faster. My right hand was in my sweatshirt pocket, all five fingers clenched around the heavy sock that was going to teach Maurice who was in charge from now on. Theres only one way I can think of to keep your mouth shut, and thats to shut it myself.</div><div class="tx">Maurice rose from the bench, and now his expression was definitely frightened. He put down his book and took a few steps toward me, and thats when I gave it to him. I reached into my pocket and <i>BAM!</i> I whacked Maurice right across that self-satisfied grin of his, and I pounded those batteries into his teeth over and over until I felt something come loose.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_003_r1.jpg" alt="003" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">I heard the sounds around me, the gasps and the cheers and the screams, but in that moment there were only two people in the entire universe, and that was me and Maurice.</div><div class="tx">Maybe the report on Lizs desk covered the highlights  of how Id barely even gotten started when Maurice collapsed onto the asphalt with both hands clasped over his mouth, and how the blood flew everywhere until it seemed to be coming out of his ears.</div><div class="tx">But no stupid-ass guidance-counselor write-up could possibly have described how <i>good</i> it felt, taking out the sock Id stashed in my backpack and slamming it hard against his face. <i>Take that, Maurice. Thatll show you not to mess with me again, not to spread around lies like they werent nothing.</i></div><div class="tx">When I pulled my hand away from his face for the last time, I suddenly became aware of how the whole scene had gone completely silent all around us: how all of those kids just stood there staring at me like I was finally something. And Id be lying if I said that didnt feel pretty damn good.</div></body></html>';

But I was okay with that because as long as she stuck to the small stuff, the minutes would keep flying by. Besides, I kind of liked getting to talk without someone always interrupting me. Ever since my mom and dad split up, it seemed like no one ever had time to listen to anything I had to say.</div><div class="tx">So, tell me, Butterballdo you have any friends at school?</div><div class="tx">I glared at her. What kind of question was that, anyway? Yeah, Ive got friends. Why wouldnt I have friends?</div><div class="tx">Sorry, I phrased that wrong, Liz said, flashing her yellow teeth at me. Of course you have friends. What I wanted to know waswell, do you care to tell me about them?</div><div class="tx">Not really, I said, and when I saw that didnt satisfy Liz, I went on, Theyre just guys. No one special. All the black kids at Watkins kind of stick together, mostly because we dont have much choice in the matter, know what I mean? I looked over at pale pasty Liz and thought, <i>No, of course she didnt.</i> Most of my real friends are in the city, but I only get to see them on the weekends I visit my dad. My boys in school here, I mean, we just hang out during the day, you knowwe dont see each other on the weekends much.</div><div class="tx">Liz nodded and jotted something down in her cheapo spiral notebook. So has it been difficult for you, leaving your old friends behind and moving to a new school?</div><div class="tx">Nah, why would it be? Like I said, I got plenty of friends here, and besides, I still go to the city all the time. If I didnt, yeah, times might be a little tougher out here in Garden City.</div><div class="tx">Another curt nod from Liz. What about girls? Do you have any . . . romantic interests?</div><div class="tx">I snorted my drink through my nose at this. Oh,  man, you really have a funny way of putting stuff, do you know that? No, I dont have any romantic interests.</div><div class="tx">All right, then, thats fine. And what about</div><div class="tx">I mean, theres this one girl whos a friend of mine. Her names Nia, and shes really nice to me. Well, not to me exactly. Shes just a nice girl, you know? To everyone. And shes having a party in two weeks that Im going to. It should be pretty tight.</div><div class="tx">Liz looked pretty interested in this little tidbit. So youre looking forward to that, then?</div><div class="tx">Isnt that what I just said? Irritated, I shook my head and looked down at my feet. My Nike X Series had been the coolest shoes ever when I got them almost two years ago, right when my parents split up and were feeling guilty about shit. My feet had grown some since then, but I didnt care. My feet hardly blistered anymore, and even if those shoes had seen better days, they still looked pretty hot. Yeah, some of the leather had faded on the sides, but nothing a little coloring in with a Sharpie couldnt fix.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_004_r1.jpg" alt="004" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">Still, I knew I needed to make a splash at Nias party the weekend after next. That is, if she ever got around to inviting me. Before, Id been pretty sure it would happen, since Nia had always been so friendly with me and all. But I hadnt been back to school since the whole deal went down at the playground, and I wasnt sure what she thought of me now. Maybe if she hadnt been there, if I hadnt caught her eye right as I walked over to Maurice . . .</div><div class="tx">Nah, but it didnt do any good to think that way. Still, I couldnt stop picturing, like a shot in slow motion, the look on her face after Coach Reese tackled me and led me back into the building with my arms pinned behind my back like I was a drug dealer or something. Nia was standing there with her mouth hanging open, and she looked scared to deathof <i>me</i>.</div><div class="tx">I heard a sound in the outer lobby. Yo, I think its time for me to take off. My moms working tonight, so she doesnt have time to sit around waiting for me. I rocked out of my seat; I couldnt wait to get out of that crazy fried-chicken-smelling cave.</div><div class="tx">All right, Butterball. Ive really enjoyed talking to you today, and I look forward to our next meeting. I think the two of us can make a lot of progress together, I really do.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, whatever. And I was out of there.</div></body></html>';

I could see the dollars and cents signs flashing. Not for the first time, I wondered, but wasnt about to ask, how much cash my mom was coughing up for these little sessions with Liz. But I figured that was my moms problem for now. Talking it out with a loser social worker in a strip mall was a whole lot cheaper that sending me to a private school as Principal James had first suggested.  Going anywhere other than Watkins was never gonna be an option.</div><div class="tx">Our next appointment took place the following Monday, right after my first day back at Watkins.</div><div class="tx">What was it like, being back in school? she said before Id even really gotten to take off my backpack and open my PowerQuench. I like to settle into things, kick my feet up, but that wasnt Lizs style.</div><div class="tx">It was . . . pretty good, actually, I said, and I was telling the truth. Though Nia had kept her distance, a bunch of other guys had actually been nice to me for the first time ever. Like they finally respected me.</div><div class="tx">Liz looked down at her notebook as she asked, Was Maurice back in school today?</div><div class="tx">It was the first time shed ever mentioned my enemy by name, and I met her stare easily, then shrugged. Yeah, I think so, but I didnt actually see him. He got transferred out of my math class, and thats the only time we ever crossed paths anyway. Watkins is a real big school, you know. There are like seven hundred people in each grade.</div><div class="tx">So thats a positive development, Liz said. The fact that Maurice is already back in school.</div><div class="tx">If you say so, I said with another shrug. And then,  when Liz resumed her psycho staring, I added, But you gotta understand, that nerd would rather take a bullet than miss his precious classes. Im sure anyone else would stay home longeryou know, take advantage of the situation to kick back a littlebut not Maurice. I laughed, thinking about what a loser he was. My boy Bobbie, he saw him in social studies and said he looked plenty messed up. But apparently there was nothing really wrong when they checked him out at the hospital. Just a split lip, but no loose teeth or nothing like that. I dont think he even needed stitches on his lip.</div><div class="tx">Thats why his nice rich parents decided not to press chargesbecause no real damage had been done.</div><div class="tx">Whos Bobbie? Liz asked, surprising me. It wasnt the follow-up question Id expected. Can you tell me about him?</div><div class="tx">Bobbies just this guy at school, I said. Hes cool.</div><div class="tx">I see, Liz said, scribbling something in her notebook.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">Bobbie was second in command of Andress posse, a kickass basketball player who was about seven feet tall and ripped and could date any girl he wanted, including at the high school. Hed high-fived me in the cafeteria that morning when Id gone in for my chocolate milk  and said I should check out Maurices busted-up face. Bobbies the one who told me Maurice was planning to eat in the nurses office from then on.</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">Anything else happen today? Liz had stopped writing and was staring at me again.</div><div class="tx">I shook my head. Nah, it was just the same old shit as always.</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">Except that at lunch Andres had high-fived me, too, and so had Darrell, and theyd even told me I should come sit with them. But by the time I had made it out of the hot-food line with my tray, their table was already full, so instead I just waved and kept on walking to my usual table in the back corner by the recycling bins no one ever used. I was pissed to see that, during my week on suspension, two geeky-ass seventh-graders had tried to edge in on my domain.</div><div class="tx">Get the hell out of here, you assholes, I said, slamming my tray down right on top of the littler kidsIm pretty sure his name was JamalFried Fish Delight. After the two kids scurried away without even taking their food with them, I had the table all to myself again, and that was just how I liked it.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_005_r1.jpg" alt="005" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">So theres nothing else you want to tell me about?</div><div class="tx">She was really persistent, this Liz. But I didnt crack that easy and kept on just shaking my head. I didnt think she cared to hear about how I actually kind of liked the way people, even teachers, looked at me differently in the halls all day long, like I was someone worthy of respect, not just another big invisible blob.</div><div class="tx">My second appointment with Liz went by faster than the first one, and by the time I walked out of there, I wasnt even in all that bad a mood. Old Liz was all right in her way. She may not be all that smart, but at least she could sit there and listen without interrupting all the time.</div><div class="tx">Outside it was rainy and cold, a deep gloominess that never seemed to fall over the city, or that all the big buildings did a good job of concealing. I saw my moms old Honda and jogged over toward it. Id already opened the passenger door before I noticed that the person behind the wheel wasnt my mom but her friend Evelyn. I hesitated, but just for a second, before sliding into the seat. I dont know why I was even surprised anymore.</div><div class="tx">Wheres my mom? I asked, looking straight ahead  of me. Because I dont need a babysitter anymore, you know.</div><div class="tx">Evelyn sighed and shook her head. Apparently you do, she murmured, as if I couldnt hear her. She only pretended to be nice when my mom was around. When it was just the two of us, the gloves came off. In a louder voice she said, Your mom is working the night shift, as I believe she told you this morning.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, yeah, right, of course she did. My mom had missed a ton of shifts during my suspension, and she hadnt let me forget it. Its just I thought the night shift didnt start till the night, and last time I checked it was like five oclock in the afternoon. But whatever.</div><div class="tx">Evelyn just sighed: her specialty. But then, after a pause, she asked, Do you have any makeup work I can help you with? Your mom thought maybe youd have a lot of assignments after a whole week away.</div><div class="tx">I can do my own damn assignments, I snapped. I dont need any help from you.</div><div class="tx">All right, then, Evelyn said in her sad old-lady way. I was just offering.</div><div class="tx">We drove the rest of the way in silence, and when we got home, Evelyn immediately switched on the TV and went into the kitchen to start dinner. She didnt say any-thing else to me, so I just sat on the couch waiting for the right time to make my escape. I was hungry, and Evelyn never made me food I liked, and she always kept the TV on stupid true-crime shows that sucked, and she didnt even watch them because she was in the next room making beans and tofu (Im not joking) and all sorts of other nasty crap no one in his right mind would eat.</div><div class="tx">After a few minutes, Evelyn came in and placed a bowl in front of me. Veggie chili, she said. Try it. Instead of looking at me, she started tidying the room, arranging our shoes in the corner and stacking up the books Id dumped out of my backpack.</div><div class="tx">I aint hungry, I said and shoved the bowl away. That wasnt true. I was starving, but I wasnt going to give Evelyn the pleasure of eating that disgusting sludge shed put in front of me.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_006_r1.jpg" alt="006" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">She didnt seem to care either way. Suit yourself,  she said. And then she stood up, switched off the TV, and walked into my moms room with a book. Well, if she didnt like me hanging around her, Id give her her precious space. Evelyn and I were pretty much through with pretending around each other.</div><div class="tx">I fished around my backpack for some money and dug out two quarters and three dimes, just enough for a Snickers bar. I spread my books out across the little table again, then grabbed my portable video camera, the Panasonic Id bought when my old flip cam got jacked on the subway, just in case I ran across anything cool to shoot. Yeah, right. There was never anything worth filming in ugly Garden City. No street life, no action at all.</div><div class="tx">Im going outside, I said after a few more minutes of silence. Evelyn didnt respond, not even to remind me of my moms favorite subject, which was that I was grounded for life. Well, screw her, too. I pounded down the steps and out the front door.</div><div class="tx">On the stoop was a little kid, Malik, who was maybe eight or nine and lived in the basement apartment with his mom and grandparents.</div><div class="tx">Get outta my way, I said and shoved him off his perch.</div><div class="tx">He fell flat on his ass on the top step and burst into tears. Whatever, Id done him a favor. Stupid little kid like that shouldnt be on the street at this time of night, not even in Garden City. He was lucky I didnt do a lot worse to him. Itd teach him a lesson.</div></body></html>';

Id only been there five minutes and already Liz was starting in again. Why wouldnt I? Hes the bomb. Wed still be living with himand be a lot happier, tooif my mom hadnt walked out on him like she did. It wasnt <i>his</i> fault she left, I added, in case that wasnt totally clear already. Sometimes you had to spell shit out for old Liz.</div><div class="tx">Liz leaned forward, nodding in that annoying way she had. And can you tell me why you think your mom, as you put it, walked out on him?</div><div class="tx">I shrugged. I couldnt believe Liz actually got paid to just sit on her ass and repeat everything I said right back  to me. Then again, I thought, looking around the dark little fried-chicken room, she clearly didnt get paid <i>that</i> much. Yeah, my mom could definitely afford Liz on the kind of overtime she worked.</div><div class="tx">Damned if I know, I said finally, when she just kept on staring at me. My moms just one of those types whos never satisfied with what shes got, you know? Nothings ever good enough for hernot her job and definitely not my dads. But it wasnt his fault he couldnt live up to some nonexistent standard of perfection she set up in her brain, was it?</div><div class="tx">So your dad, Liz said, he wanted your mom to stay?</div><div class="tx">Hell, yes, he wanted her to stayhavent you been listening? For that whole first year, he was practically begging her to come back. Im his only kid, you know? He took that seriously.</div><div class="tx">So how would you describe your mom and dads relationship right now? Liz asked. Is itproductive? Would you say your dad is still interested in, ah, holding onto your mother?</div><div class="tx">Nah, I think my dads kind of moved on by this point, I said. I saw no reason to mention Diane, the skanky Dallas BBQ waitress whod been hanging around  his place the last few times Id visited.</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">The last weekend I was in the city, the same trip I bought the D batteries to fill my old sock, Dad and Diane had spent most of Saturday inside the bedroom, with the door closed and the hip-hop music blasting so loudly I wouldnt have been able to hear anything even if Id wanted to, which I didnt. Id been hoping to go out and window-shop for some new shoes, but I wasnt about to interrupt whatever nasty business they had going on, and my dad liked when I asked permission before hitting the streets. That was about the only rule he had, which was yet another reason I looked forward to visiting him.</div><div class="tx">I spent most of Saturday watching Turner Classic Movies, which I could never have done at my moms place, and not only because shes too cheap to shell out for cable. Shes anti-TV, even if the TV Im watching happens to be prime classic cinema. If nothing else I love weekends at my dads for his deluxe cable package.</div><div class="tx">Howd a good-looking man like you get such a fattie for a kid? Diane had asked, and I tried not to notice when my dad busted up laughing and told her it was a real good question. But that was always how my dad had acted around the women in his life, including my mom.  In my personal opinion, he let the ladies boss him around a little too much.</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">Id say my mom and dad still get along pretty well, I told Liz. Hes dated a bunch of different women, but no one serious. The same goes for my mom. Even though shes the one who did the dumping, shes stayed single ever since we moved out to Garden City, so I dont know, could be shes still a little hung up on him?</div><div class="tx">I see, said Liz, nodding as if shed just figured out the answer to some really complicated math problem. She actually reminded me a little of my math teacher Mrs. Fleming that way, and I dont mean that as a compliment. I wondered how many black kids Liz had coming to her practicethats what she called itand what the rest of them thought of that stupid sailboat painting hanging lopsided over Lizs head. So you said something earlier about not seeing your Garden City friends much on the weekends. How many weekends a month would you say you spend with your dad?</div><div class="tx">Two, I answered. I mean, thats what they agreed on when my mom first moved out here, but sometimes it works out to more like . . . The thing is, my dad works a lot, so when hes on a job, it can be hard to take time  off. And then my mom is sometimes too busy to drive me into the cityits not all that close, you know, and she doesnt like me riding the train on my own, which is crazy since in the city Ive been riding the subway since I was like six. But anyway, yeah, sometimes its more like one weekend a month, and sometimes its three if my moms working a ton. It really just sort of depends.</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">Last time I was over there, on Saturday night Dad actually kicked Diane outwhich she said was fine because she was working that night anyway, and she made more in one shift than his lazy ass earned in a weekso he could take me to the big Magic Johnson Theater on 125<sup>th</sup> Street. He told me I could pick out any movie I wanted; I just had to name it.</div><div class="tx">Another thing about my mom: She <i>never</i> takes me to movies. She says theyre a big waste of money when you could watch the same crap on TV for free, and a complete waste of time, too. We all knew that time was a pretty precious commodity to my mom, who, ever since she left my dad to better our lives, spent every second of the day either working a double shift as an orderly at St. Vincents, or attending a class at nursing school, or studying for a class, or catching up on sleep. There was,  she said so herself, very little left afterward.</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">How would you say your dad and you spend your weekends together? Liz asked, still jotting down stupid shit in her notebook. You guys ever do anything special?</div><div class="tx">I shrugged. Nah, I dont know. We just dostuff. We hang out with some of my old school friends, and some friends hes made since we left the citybefore Diane there was Tina, and before Tina there was Alexisand sometimes we play some b-ball and sometimes we go to the movies. Thats what I like best, when he takes me to the movies.</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">I chose <i>Battleground: LA</i> because Id always been a sucker for post-apocalyptic urban shit, and my dad said okay and bought the tickets. He got us popcorn, which was great even if he felt like he had to add, I dont think you need the extra butter, boy. When we got inside the theater, we sat down next to each other in the dark, and about five minutes into the previews my dad fell dead asleep. He works really hard, my dadright now theyre putting up a new condo building across the street from Marcus Garvey Parkand he and Diane had been up really late the night before. So I didnt mind at all that he slept  for two hours straight and didnt wake up till after the final credits had rolled and the lights had come back on. Earlier hed said we could grab a couple of burgers on the way home, but sometimes when my dad naps, he has trouble waking up afterward. So instead, after pointing out that my ass sure didnt need another burger on it, anyway, my dad suggested we just head back uptown to have dinner in his apartment.</div><div class="tx">The only problem was that my dads refrigerator was completely empty, and there was no food anywhere else in the apartment, either. About thirty seconds after he let us into the apartment, my dad collapsed onto his messy bed and fell right back asleep. I lay awake on the couch for hours afterward, my stomach growling over the background buzz of the city on the other side of the window. But the movie was really great, as good as everyone said for sure. The special effects were just mind-blowing.</div></body></html>';

Hey, Mom, I said, totally taken aback by the scene before me. Have I forgotten my own birthday or something?</div><div class="tx">She gave me a look and shook her head. Very funny. No, sweetie. I just thought you might want pancakes this morning, thats all.</div><div class="tx">I looked around the kitchen, which was crazy tidy, almost sparkling, like in a TV commercial or something. Mom had sure gotten up early. So youre not working today? Did you get fired? Whats up?</div><div class="tx">Mom stirred the batter with a wooden spoon. Ha, ha. No, I took the day offwhats so strange about that? I just feel like I havent seen enough of you lately.</div><div class="tx">The thing that was strange about my mom taking the day off was that she hadnt taken a day off in almost two years, not since shed started studying for her R.N. degree. My mom wanted to be a nurse so bad, shed work twenty-four-hour shifts as an orderly just to be in the thick of the whole hospital scene she loved so much. So that meanthmm. I looked at her suspiciously.</div><div class="tx">She said, I was thinking we could do something together, just the two of us. Like maybe we could go to the zoo, what do you think?</div><div class="tx">Now I <i>knew</i> shed lost it. That, or the school had forced her to spend more time with me as a condition of my rehabilitation. Seemed like my mom would do anything to keep me out of the expensive Catholic school on the other side of town from Watkins.</div><div class="tx">The zoo? I said. Mom, Im 13, not 5. Im going to high school next year, for crying out loud. And then, for the first time, I looked around the apartment, which seemed tidier than usual, and emptier. Is Evelyn coming, too? I asked.</div><div class="tx">My mom appeared to think this was the craziest  question ever. No, why would she? Evelyns visiting family in Jersey this weekend, she said. I cant remember when she said shed be back.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, right. So thats the deal then? Everyone-spend- time-with-their-family-day, that it?</div><div class="tx">Here, sit down, Mom said, arranging a stack of pancakes on one of our old plates. I even went out and got new syrup this morning. I hadnt noticed we were out.</div><div class="tx">That was probably because she hadnt opened a single kitchen cabinet in the almost eighteen months since wed moved out here. But because I was still treading on thin ice with her after my suspension, I was careful not to say anything that might piss her off. Instead I pulled up a chair to the dinky kitchen table, which was mostly used as a storage surface for all the bills and pizza menus shoved into our little mailbox every day, and dug into the pancakes.</div><div class="tx">I couldnt remember the last time Id actually had a meal here, and Id be lying if I said I wasnt excited to chow down. Because unlike Evelyn, my mom can actually cook, and whats more, she knows what I like to eat. Thats the only reason it bothered me that for the lastI dont even know how longId lived off bodega snacks  and frozen pizzas, unless of course Evelyn was around to prepare one of her extra-special stews.</div><div class="tx">So, Bunny, Mom said, glancing over at me from the stove. How was your week at school?</div><div class="tx">Fine, I said, then took another big bite. I knew what my mom was going for, but I wasnt taking the bait. I was too busy working my way through that second stack of pancakes.</div><div class="tx">I heard that the other boy, that friend of yours . . .</div><div class="tx">I didnt even have to shut my mom up because right then her cell phone rang. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yes, all right, she said in her desperate-to-be-a-nurse voice, and even her expression became serious and stern. Yes, well, of course, I understand.</div><div class="tx">She hung up the phone and turned off the hob where the last pancake was still sizzling. She walked over to me and pulled up the other rickety chair to the table. Bunny, she said, Im so sorry but</div><div class="tx">I could fill in the rest in my sleep, so I decided to save her the trouble. Yeah, yeah, I got it. Theres been a big emergency and the hospital has a staff shortage and if you dont clock in right this very minute, the whole place will fall apart and burn right to the ground. Is that pretty much the gist?</div><div class="tx">Mom sighed and reached out to rub my arms. Oh, Bunny, Ive been looking forward to surprising you all week. But you know Ive only been at St. Vincents for a couple of months, and I already missed all those days when you were home. If they dont think they can lean on me, well, by the time I qualify as a nurse, who knows if theyll want to keep me on there? I mean, in this job market, I really am lucky to have gotten such a great job so close to home. I dont want to take any chances.</div><div class="tx">Aight, I got you. Its cool because I already had plans today, anyway.</div><div class="tx">Moms face lit up, and she leaned back in her chair as if to inspect me from a new angle. You did? With who? She seemed to have forgotten that I was grounded for life.</div><div class="tx">Just with some guys, Mom, I said. You wouldnt know them.</div><div class="tx">Oh, well, thats just wonderful, Bunny. Im so pleased to hear that. Do you need some money?</div><div class="tx">I shook my head, but she was already fishing through her wallet. Whoa, this was weird. She took out a ten-dollar billa small fortune in the brain of my cheapskate momand placed it in front of me on the table. Here you go, sweetie. Dont spend it all in one place, okay?</div><div class="tx">Thanks, Ma, I grumbled, trying not to let her see me rolling my eyes. Just send me a text when youre on your way back, will you?</div><div class="tx">You know I always do. It should be before midnight, I promise you that.</div><div class="tx">Before midnight, I thought. That was just great.</div></body></html>';

Then I could <i>really</i> make some cinema. Yeah, rightmaybe next lifetime. When I was done, I plopped onto the couch and tried to find something decent to watch on TV. But my mom refuses to spend money on cable, so it was all stupid kids cartoons and a bunch of old white guys sitting around talking about the state of the world. Sometime around two, when there were no more pancakes in the apartment, I laced up my sneakers and headed outside to see if anything was happening on the mean streets of Garden City. Ha.</div><div class="tx">Id been walking up and down Elgin Avenue, filming the shadows my legs made on the cracked sidewalk, when I saw that guy Andres from my class.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_007_r1.jpg" alt="007" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">Yo, Butterball! he called out to me. He was coming out of the Checkers with a big soda cup in his hand. I waited for the light to turn and jogged over toward him.</div><div class="tx">Hey, man, he said when I caught up with him. Whats going on?</div><div class="tx">Nothing, man, just roaming the streets, I said. Heading over to the bodega for a PowerQuench and thats about it.</div><div class="tx">Ill come with you, Andres said, and I hoped he didnt see the smile that spread across my face when he clapped me on the shoulder kind of like we was friends. A bunch of the guys are heading over to the playground to shoot some hoops if you wanted to come with us.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, that sounds fun, I said, and it did. But the truth is, Im a terrible basketball player, like one of the  all-time worst. I was bad even before I put on all this extra weight, and now . . . Well, now I couldnt even imagine. But I hurt my foot when I was suspended, I went on. I was hanging with my dad in the city and this crazy guy on a motorcycle swerved onto the sidewalk and almost took my foot off.</div><div class="tx">This had actually happenedbut to my dad, and about seven years ago. He still talked about it all the time. Andres, luckily, wasnt paying much attention. He only nodded and said, Yeah, Im not playing either. Therere gonna be girls there, and Im putting my energy where it matters.</div><div class="tx">He laughed and though I didnt really get it, I joined in. Pretty soon wed walked the four blocks down Elgin that led to the playground of our school, the exact place where Maurice and I had faced off just two weeksbut what felt like a lifetimeago. It seemed like a kind of weird place to hang out on the weekend, but Garden City isnt that exciting a town, and we had to work with what we got.</div><div class="tx">When we got there no one was playing basketball. It was just me, Andres, Bobbie, and Darrell, who I didnt know all that well. After wed sat around for a couple of minutes a group of girls showed up. They all ignored me, of courseJanine went right up to Darrell, who I guess she  was dating, and the rest of them huddled on the asphalt a few feet away from us guys, where they proceeded to whisper and stare and giggle every couple of seconds.</div><div class="tx">I was just standing around, not talking to anyone and wondering if maybe it wasnt such a hot idea for me to have come here, when Nia walked onto the court.</div><div class="tx">She looked over at me, then just as quickly flicked her eyes away and headed over to join the semicircle of girls. I knew I had to say something to her, but I wasnt sure where to begin, or how. After a few minutes I decided to just ask her directly. Whatd I have to lose?</div><div class="tx">Yo, Nia, how you doing? I called over to her.</div><div class="tx">The group of girls burst into laughter, but not Nia. She just flinched a little before quickly composing her face into a smile. Before, Nia had been the one, the only one, whod been nice to me, but now she seemed, I dont know, almost frightened.</div><div class="tx">Andres poked me in the side. Go on, go talk to her. You can tell shes itching to get down with old Butterball!</div><div class="tx">I glanced over at Nia again, hoping she hadnt heard. Before Andres could make any other jokes, I went ahead and shuffled over to her. At my approach, her four friends dispersed like birds whod just had a rock thrown at them.  You aight? I said.</div><div class="tx">She nodded but still wouldnt look at me. Sure Im all right. Why wouldnt I be?</div><div class="tx">I decided I might as well just come out and say it. Hey, Nia, that thing you saw? I said. It wasnt what you thought. I mean, Maurice and me, we had a private score to settle, thats all. He only got what was coming to him, know what I mean?</div><div class="tx">Nia kept her eyes firmly fixed on the asphalt under our feet. It was awful what you did to him. I mean, what could he possibly have done to deserve <i>that</i>? Ive known Maurice since kindergarten, and hes always been a nice guy. And nowI mean, you ruined him, Butterball, you know that? Hes starting at Strake next week, did you hear? One week back at Watkins and he couldnt handle it. So his parents transferred him out.</div><div class="tx">I didnt like it, the way Nia was lecturing me, almost like she was Liz or Evelyn or something. It wasnt cool. Yeah, well, his damn parents can afford it, so lucky for Maurice he finally got his wish. Its always been his dream to go to a fancy school with a bunch of tight-ass kids with their heads buried in books all the time. I mean, really, what could be better for Mauricea place where he can be surrounded by even <i>more</i> white people?</div><div class="tx">I laughed at the expression on Nias face and went on, I only wished Id gotten to see him one more time, if you know what I mean, before he took off. See if hed learned his lesson for good.</div><div class="tx">Nia had no response to this, but she looked more freaked out by me than ever.</div><div class="tx">Hey, Butterball, man, cmere, Bobbie called out suddenly, and I glanced over toward the basket where he and the guys were still standing in a semicircle. The girls were several few feet away all huddled together. Only me and Nia were on our own, a good distance down the court from the rest of them. She was still looking away from me, so I trotted over to Bobbie and the guys.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_008_r1.jpg" alt="008" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">So what were you and Nia talking about so hush-hush like that? Andres wanted to know.</div><div class="tx">I shrugged. Nothing much. Just talking.</div><div class="tx">Do you like Nia? Andres asked me, a smile spreading across his face.</div><div class="tx">Yeah. I mean, shes a really nice girl. I like talking to her.</div><div class="tx">This, for some reason, cracked the boys up. They all exchanged fist bumps, and Bobbie said, Ah, yeah, <i>talking</i> to her. Thats what I like to do with the shorties.</div><div class="tx">But then Andres got serious all of a sudden. So speaking of Nia, he said, you know shes got a big party planned two weeks from now, dont you? Her moms gonna be outta town, so its gonna be bumping.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, I said. I think I mightve heard something about it.</div><div class="tx">And do you know whos gonna be at that party? Andres asked. You know a guy by the name of Terrence Jackson?</div><div class="tx">I shook my head. Should I?</div><div class="tx">Dont know. He lives around here, but he goes to Central now.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, and thank God for that, Bobbie murmured. Id kill that mofo dead if I had to see his face every day.</div><div class="tx">Id do the same if someone stole my girl, Darrell said.</div><div class="tx">His girl? I glanced over at Janine, who was against the fence, whispering something into Nias ear. I saw Nia giggle. You mean Janine? I asked.</div><div class="tx">Hell, no, I dont mean Janine! Bobbie said, sounding almost annoyed. I mean, dont get me wrong, shes a nice enough girl, but Janines main advantage is that shes around.</div><div class="tx">But I thought</div><div class="tx">Nah, man, Im talking about Tammy. That girl was <i>fine</i>.</div><div class="tx">He was psycho over her, Darrell said. Totally psycho.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, Andres said. The only girl our man ever really liked.</div><div class="tx">Bobbie exhaled noisily through his mouth. Yeah, and Terrence started messing around with Tammy behind my back, and no ones ever done that to me before. And now I hear hes got his sights set on Niathats how come hes going to her party, you know? To put the moves on her hard.</div><div class="tx">So Terrence and Tammy arent together anymore? I was having a little trouble following the whole deal.</div><div class="tx">The boys all exchanged glances. No, man, arent you following at all? Andres said. A dog like that, he moves fast. He dont stick with any one woman for too long. Terrence is showing up at that party to put the moves on Nia, and theres only one way to stop that from happening. The three of them were looking right at me.</div><div class="tx">Hows that? I asked slowly.</div><div class="tx">Well, by him getting punished, thats how, Andres said this as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. By our man Butterball, to be more precise.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, Bobbie said, a nice sock in his teeth might teach that dog a thing or two about whose girls not to mess with.</div><div class="tx">I remembered that strange sad look that had flickered across Nias face a few minutes earlier and shook my head. But Nias not my girl, I said, and she wouldnt be in a million years. And Ive never even heard of the guyTerrence, you said his name was? Besides, Im not even sure if Im invited yet, you know?</div><div class="tx">The boys totally cracked up at this. Invited? Andres said. Are you joking, boy? You mean youre waiting for a card in the mail, like? Oh, man, Butterball, sometimes I gotta wonder about what goes on in that fatass brain of yours.</div><div class="tx">Thats not what I meant, man, I said, straightening myself up. Its just that I might be in the city that weekend, thats all. I never know what my schedule with my dad is in advance. Hes a busy guy.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, well, if you do make the party, Andres said, just dont forget the batteries, aight? Thats all Is saying.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, Nia would totally love that shit, Bobbie said. Show her whos boss.</div><div class="tx">Got it, I said. Show her whos boss. Yeah, I get you.</div></body></html>';

I swear she could look at me without blinking for what felt like the whole forty-five minutes, and if I was getting used to the ugly sailboat painting, her long-ass stares still wigged me out a little.</div><div class="tx">Would you say your moms schedule makes you unhappy ? Liz asked me for maybe the tenth time since Id started coming here. For Liz, repetition was really the spice of life.</div><div class="tx">Nah, not at all, I said. I like it, actually, because I get more time to kick back with my friends and shoot my movies and shit like that. Plus its nice that mom has a  little more money than she ever did before. It makes shit more comfortable, you know?</div><div class="tx"><i>Not that she usually spent any of her cash on me</i>, I thought, glancing down at my raggedy-ass sneakers. But whatever. Mom truly believed that all her penny-pinching would somehow open doors for me in the future, and at least my dad wasnt as tight-fisted with his cash.</div><div class="tx">Which reminded me: I <i>had</i> to ask him for some new shoes. This weekend, Id bring it up. My dad definitely understood the importance of a man looking his best, or so he was always telling me, and it had been almost a year since Id asked him to buy me anything. There was no way he could turn me down.</div><div class="tx">Tell me, were you ever angry at your mom for packing up your lives and moving out here? Maybe a little in the very beginning?</div><div class="tx">I thought about this. Angry? Nah, Im not sure Id use that word. She has her reasons for doing stuff.</div><div class="tx">And have the two of you ever talked about what those reasons are? What I mean to say is . . . Well, Im sensing some anger in you, in the way you talk about your mother and the move out here, and I just wondered if youve ever really had it out with her about your issues.</div><div class="tx">I shook my head. It really was crazy, the extent to which Liz just didnt get it. Issues? I dont care what shit youre sensing, but I dont have any issues, lady, I mean Liz. And besides, thats not really my moms style. Whats that thing she always says? Oh, yeah. Im a doer, not a talker. And thats pretty much true. My mom probably would have driven my dad crazy a lot earlier if shed been into that touchy-feely shit.</div><div class="tx">Do you ever wish your mom was different? Liz asked. That she was easier to talk to?</div><div class="tx">I scoffed at this. Why would I? I love my mom, always have and always will. Sure, we have our fights, and yeah, sometimes Im not as into this town as she is, but so what? Anyway, shes right. It doesnt do anyone any good to talk about stuff, you know?</div><div class="tx">Well, if it doesnt do any good to talk about stuff, then why exactly are you here? Liz asked.</div><div class="tx">I mean, damn, would she <i>never</i> get it into that brain of hers that I was here because I had to be here? Because I had like the opposite of a choice in the matter?</div><div class="tx">She mustve seen the look on my face because she quickly changed her tune. A little earlier you said your mom and you fight sometimes. What do you fight about exactly, would you say?</div><div class="tx">I dont know. All kinds of things. Just the regular mom stuff.</div><div class="tx">Like what? Can you give me one specific example?</div><div class="tx">Liz was really irritating me now. I told you I dont know! Like, she makes me look stupid sometimes, the way she treats me. And I never can have people over to our place because . . .</div><div class="tx">Because why? Liz prodded.</div><div class="tx">Because shes never around long enough to clean it up and it looks like shit all the time, thats why, I snapped. Youd think a woman so set on bettering our lives would clean up the kitchen once a month or so, but then youd be dead wrong. My moms so busy cleaning up after people at work all the time that she never has time to clean up after herself. At least thats her excuse.</div><div class="tx">Liz was eyeing me with a new expression, and I realized Id broken my own rules and let myself get a little heated up. She looked almost proud of herself, and that wasnt gonna fly with me.</div><div class="tx">Have you ever talked to her about that? she asked gently, but I could see through her whole deal. About how the mess really bothers you?</div><div class="tx">Yo, Im not saying it bothers me, aight? Im just saying its a thing my mom and I fight about sometimes,  since you asked for specifics and all. She always says I should start by cleaning up after myself, but thats not really the point, know what I mean? When she lived with my dad, she always kept the place real tidy, but now, well . . . I dont know whats happened to her since then. Its kind of like shes just given up on a bunch of shit.</div><div class="tx">Liz didnt say anything for a while, almost as if by waiting shed trick me into talking again. But this time I wasnt having it. I could stare as good as anyone else.</div><div class="tx">What else, then? Any other sore subjects? Liz asked after maybe five minutes of this forced silence. She had her pen poised right over that spiral. But she had another think coming because I was finished.</div><div class="tx">Nope, not really. My whole situation is pretty sweet. I mean, in a funny way, my mom and I get along better on account of not seeing each other all that much, you know? We dont get the chance to get up in each others grill like we used to. I get the best of both worlds, kind of. Relaxing school shit out here, and crazy fun weekends in the city with my dad.</div><div class="tx">Liz nodded slowly, and to tell the truth she looked a little pissed, though why that could be I had no idea. Then she looked straight at me. Butterballshe always drew in a little breath before she could bring herself  to say itI really believe you wouldnt be coming here if your life were so perfect.</div><div class="tx">Yeah? I met her stare. Thats funny because Im was pretty sure I was coming here on account of hitting Maurice. I dont know what the hell that has to do with my life one way or another.</div><div class="tx">And why exactly did you hit Maurice? she asked me challengingly. Thats the question we still havent come close to answering.</div><div class="tx">Ah, lady, I said, I mean, Liz. If you knew that, youd know everything, wouldnt you? And no offense, but I aint about to let that happen.</div><div class="tx">Liz let out a long breathyep, shed sure met her match this timeand leaned back in her chair. All right then, she said. Lets back up a little. How about you tell me about your first day here? Your first day at Watkins, I mean. Anything stand out for you?</div><div class="tx">What do you mean, my first day at Watkins? That was almost two years ago now. Who remembers that far back?</div><div class="tx">Moving to a new place can be really hard, especially at the beginning.</div><div class="tx">Man, Lizs pearls of wisdom were really nonstop today! I laughed out loud. Well, it wasnt for me. Ive  always been pretty good with meeting people and shit like that.</div><div class="tx">So your first day at Watkins was fine?</div><div class="tx">Yeah, of course it was, from what I remember. Isnt that what I just told you? Fine and dandy. Why wouldnt it be?</div></body></html>';

When I walked into the room five minutes late, still clutching that Xeroxed hallway map to my chestnot that it had done much to help me navigate that rat maze of a schooleveryone fell silent and just stared. Not even Mr. Parker offered me a smile of welcome. What a way to start seventh grade.</div><div class="tx">The thing is, it wasnt even the start of seventh grade. School had already been in session for a couple of weeks, but of course my mom had been completely wrapped up  in getting out her nursing school applications, and then applying for financial aid when she got accepted into the nursing program at Nassau Community College, and last but not least securing her side job as an orderly at St. Vincents. She said shed been focused on finding an apartment zoned to the best possible school district, which was a big joke to anyone who has actually been to J. Watkins.</div><div class="tx">Nah, I knew how my mom worked, and as usual Id been nothing but an afterthought in her whole scheme. As if being fat and black in this town didnt put a target on my back already, Mom made sure every single student at Watkins would know Id just moved here by waiting till early October to transfer me in.</div><div class="tx">My last year in the city had also been my last year in elementary school, when me and my friends had all been kings of the hill. But at Watkins Junior High, I was less than nothing. Even in the best of circumstancesand mine were the worsta seventh-grader was the lowest of the low, the very bottom of the heap. And of course I didnt know a single damn person, not just in the school, but in the whole shitty town of Garden City.</div><div class="tx">When I walked in the room and everyone was just gaping at me, I noticed Nia right away. She was one of only a couple of black kids in the class, sitting right  there in the front row with that perfect posture and those liquid black eyes of hers, and when she looked at me that first time, she smiled. That first day at Watkins was brutal, and I think Nia mightve been the only one in that whole factory to smile at me like that.</div><div class="tx">Mr. Parker took his sweet time adjusting his precious seating chart and making everyone move to accommodate the new student, otherwise known as me. He read out my name to the class, and I didnt blink as the usual chorus of giggles filled the roomyet another thing I have to thank my mom for.</div><div class="tx">After what felt like an eternity, he finally pointed me to the desk in the back row, and I was making my way through the aisle when someone said, Watch out, wide load coming through!</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_009_r1.jpg" alt="009" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">Yeah, man, what a butterball, someone else said.</div><div class="tx">I still dont know what genius came up with my name; all I know is that it stuck. The whole class burst out laughing, and I could feel Nias gentle eyes burning into the back of my skull as I hunched over and continued walking toward the back of the room. Already I hated this place, and I hated my mom for making me come here. And I hated my big ass, even though it wasnt nearly as bad back then as it is now.</div><div class="tx">Hey, Im Maurice, the guy next to me said, and I nodded at him, the only one in the room besides Nia who wasnt cracking up at me. I told him my name, too, but already my fate at Watkins was sealed: I was, and forever more would be, Butterball, the fat black kid who could barely squeeze through the homeroom aisle.</div><div class="tx">Maurice was a loner just like me, and by the end of that first week we were eating lunch together, always the only two guys at the end of the long table by the recycling bins. Maurice was cool, and hed seen a lot of movies, too (including <i>The Dark Knight</i> at the IMAX, which was awesome). Maurice read constantly, mostly sci-fi fantasy stuff Id only before known as movies, and studied all the  time and actually went around saying that he wanted to be a lawyer one day. So yeah, he was a nerd, but a nice nerd, or thats what I thought in the beginning.</div><div class="tx">A couple of weeks into seventh grade, Maurice invited me to his place to play video games. His house was really coolfor one thing, because it was a real house, with a yard and a single mailbox and even a flower garden out front, nothing like the crowded walkups Id lived in my whole life. Maurices crib was the reason people moved to the suburbs in the first place. My moms apartment was just as cramped and crowded as any place wed ever lived in the city. The only difference was that there was never anything cool going down on the other side of the window.</div><div class="tx">Another thing about Maurice was that his parents were still together. Even in Garden City, that was pretty rare with most of the kids I met. But Maurices dad always wore crisp button-down shirts and came home from work early, around five, when I was still over playing the X-Box, and asked me questions in a soft voice while his mother cooked dinner from scratch. It was weird, and sometimes Maurices place felt a little like a movie set, totally removed from reality.</div><div class="tx">That was almost two years ago now. Like I told Liz,  I can hardly remember any of that shit anymore. It seems like I was born hating Maurices guts. Everything that came before is just a hazy blur.</div></body></html>';

You gonna give my mom a discount for this? I asked her as I gathered up my backpack.</div><div class="tx">What do you mean? Liz looked at me with a confused expression. Im telling you, this lady was <i>slow</i>.</div><div class="tx">I mean like give her 10 percent off or whatever, since youre bailing early?</div><div class="tx">Ah, I see. Liz smiled and said, I end our sessions when I feel weve reached a natural stopping point. That could be after thirty minutes, or a whole hour. Its really left to my discretion. I think weve made some nice progress today, but youre clearly done. So I see no real need to push  it.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, right. I could tell from all the makeup shed piled on, and the way her hair was combed and styled instead of just being pulled back into a messy bun, that Liz had plans that evening. I couldnt for the life of me imagine who in a million years would choose to be seen in public with her, even in this shithole of a town, so maybe she was just gonna treat herself to a half-bucket of chicken from the place next door.</div><div class="tx">Whatever sad old Liz did with herself, I was just happy shed let me out early. I knew Evelyn was scheduled to pick me up that afternoon, and I didnt feel like making her job any easier than I had to. I just wasnt in the mood to hang around the apartment all night while she folded clothes and stacked up all my personal belongings like she had some right to them.</div><div class="tx">So I hopped off the couch and, without saying goodbye to Liz, pounded down the staircase and out into the big parking lot. Watkins was just a few blocks away, and school had only let out an hour ago. I figured Id swing by on my way home, see if anything was going down over at the playground.</div><div class="tx">Lo and behold, the basketball court was packed with little clusters of people that afternoon, the blacks on one  end and all the Hispanic kids on the other. Most of the white kids had gone home already, off to their violin lessons or whatever kind of enriching shit kept them so busy all the time.</div><div class="tx">I was in a pretty good mood that afternoon, both because Liz had gone easy on me and because I was going to my dads in the morning. I didnt usually get to visit him so much, but St. Vincents was more understaffed than usual at the moment, or so my mom kept saying on the phone to him the night before: Yeah, and you shouldnt be complaining because the more I work, the less money Ill be needing from you. Then she went on in a hushed voice about all the shifts shed missed while shed been dragging me from the principals to the guidance counselors and finally to Lizs office, as if I hadnt already heard it a hundred times already.</div><div class="tx">So, yeah, I was pretty pumped to hang with my dad again, and when I walked up to the spot where Andres and some other guys were standing, I told them all about it. Yep, I go to the city most weekends, I said. So much more shit to do there.</div><div class="tx">I could tell Andres and the boys were impressed, and I sort of felt sorry for them. Most kids around here, even the ones who were sure they were badasses, have been  stuck in the suburbs all their lives and only get to go into the city on special occasions, like for Christmas shopping and shit like that. I seriously dont know what Id do if I had to spend every weekend stuck in this crappy little town where there was nothing to do but shoot hoops on an empty basketball court. Boring, boring, boring. It might not seem like much, but at least I <i>knew</i> there was life beyond Garden City, Long Island.</div><div class="tx">What you guys getting up to in New York town? Andres asked, clearly jealous.</div><div class="tx">Not much, I said. Shopping for some shoes and shit like thatmy dad promised me some new ones.</div><div class="tx">Its about time, huh? Darrell said, and all the boys laughed like this was the most hilarious joke ever, like theyd actually talked about it before. I felt my skin go cold. These shoes were the best ones on earth when I got them, but nowsure, theyd seen better days, but so what?</div><div class="tx">I looked at Darrells shoes, off-brand Adidas probably from the same strip mall where Liz had her office, and I said, Yeah, well, Ive just been waiting for the new Foamposites to come out, but they keep selling out faster than I can get to them. I wont wear just anything, you know. Unlike some people, I hope my tone implied.</div><div class="tx">All of a sudden, I heard my name being called out behind me. I spun around to see none other than Evelyn the Buzzkill standing there, shouting my namemy actual <i>name</i>at the top of her lungs. Let me tell you, I was <i>pissed</i>, so pissed I couldve taken that PQ bottle in my hand and crushed it against her skull.</div><div class="tx">Chill out, woman, I shouted as I trotted over to her. What do you want, and howd you find me here, anyway?</div><div class="tx">Dumb luck, Evelyn said without smiling. Why werent you waiting outside Ms. Jenners office like youre supposed to? Your mom will <i>not</i> be happy when she finds out I had to go on this little scavenger hunt to track you down.</div><div class="tx">I decided to play dumb and deny Evelyn the satisfaction she so clearly craved. Oh, man, Im real sorry about that, I said, super sweet and innocent-like. I knew my mom got called into work early today, so I figured Id just walk straight home on my own. I was just passing by here when I ran into some of my friends.</div><div class="tx">I see, Evelyn said skeptically. I could tell she didnt believe me, but she didnt have the balls to fight me on it, which suited my purposes fine. Well, its too bad you werent where you were supposed to be, because now  you might miss your train.</div><div class="tx">My train? I repeated. What do you mean, my train?</div><div class="tx">Yes, as you said, your mom did get called into work today, and it looks like she wont be off till well after midnight. Id stay and watch you, but Ive got a scheduled shift tonight, too, unfortunately.</div><div class="tx">Evelyn also worked at St. Vincents, though as an administrator who answered phones and shit like thatnot, like my mom, as an orderly with dreams of nursing. Thats where she and mom had first met. Anyway, your fathers agreed to watch you tonight, so your mothers asked me to drop you off at the train station. She doesnt want you getting into the city after dark, though, so its either the four-fifty train or nothing.</div><div class="tx">I rolled my eyes at my mothers crazy paranoia, but I was too souped to feel any real irritation. My mom <i>never</i> let me take the LIRR to the city on my own, though I have no idea why since Id been riding the subway alone practically since birth. Aw, I can get to my dads place blindfolded, I said.</div><div class="tx">Well, wed rather you didnt, Evelyn replied, stern as ever. So get moving. I already packed your weekend bag and put it in the car, but wheres your backpack?</div><div class="tx">Right over there, I said, pointing to where the boys were standing, watching me and Evelyn with way too much interest. Ill go grab it.</div><div class="tx">I somehow managed to keep from panting on my jog back over to the boys. That your mom or something? Andres asked. Shes fine, aint she?</div><div class="tx">That lady? I tried not to puke. No way shes my mom, and she is <i>not</i> fine, I said, reaching down for my stuff. Shes just this annoying woman who helps out while my moms at work.</div><div class="tx">Thats funny, he said, because she sure was busting your balls like shed given birth to you or something, though she do seem awful young.</div><div class="tx">Thats cause Im taking the train into the city right now, I said, and shes bugging out about my missing it.</div><div class="tx">But youll be around next weekend, though, right? Andres made sure to ask as I backed away from the semicircle.</div><div class="tx">Hell, yeah, Im going, I said without thinking. Maybe Ill even premiere my shoes there.</div><div class="tx">All right then, dont forget your sock and batteries, B-Ball! Bobbie called. I nodded but didnt turn around, just kept right on walking across the basketball court toward where Evelyn stood waiting for me.</div></body></html>';

The train was already there, so Evelyn pressed some cash into my hand and told me to hurry up. I grabbed my bag and jumped out of the car, slamming the door behind me without another word to my pissed-off chauffeur.</div><div class="tx">I can move pretty fast for a fatass, and I jogged past the station barriers and climbed the two steps up onto the train with maybe ten seconds to spare before it churned into motion. I found an empty row and looked out just in time to see Evelyn walking briskly onto the platform, looking anxiously both ways to make sure Id boarded. <i>And what if I hadnt,</i> I thought smugly as I  slid down lower into my window seat. <i>What was she gonna do then?</i></div><div class="tx">A few minutes into the ride, I noticed that a kid sitting across the aisle kept staring over at me, which I have to admit pissed me off. About the tenth time he looked my way, I bugged out my eyes and raised a fist over my head. His eyes shot right back to the seat back in front of him. A few minutes later, he got up and never came back.</div><div class="tx">I got off at Penn Station and transferred to the 3 train uptown, just like Id done a hundred times before. The train was packed at rush hour, but I didnt mind standing and holding onto the handrail. It made me feel alive, invigorated, to be surrounded by so many people who didnt know or care who I was or what my problems were. Everything was more interesting here, even the tired strangers lugging their bags of groceries home. In Garden City, everyone lived all closed off from everyone else, locked inside their cars and all those empty spaced-apart buildings.</div><div class="tx">When I got off at 148<sup>th</sup> Street, I wanted to linger but knew my mom would probably be checking in on me, so I hustled straight to my dads. I arrived at his apartment building only eighty minutes after Evelyn had dropped me offa record. I rang my dads bell and waited, but no one  buzzed me in. That was strange, but maybe my dad was napping or something. And it was only six ten, and my dad wasnt expecting me till a quarter after, or so Evelyn had said. He was probably on his way back right now.</div><div class="tx">Over the next half hour, I hit the buzzer maybe a dozen more times before I knew for sure that something was wrong. I couldnt decide what to do, whether to stay or go. Dad was always talking about getting a key made for me, but for some reason he never got around to it. Hes a busy guy, I know that as well as anybody.</div><div class="tx">Just before seven, I gave up and walked over to the bodega, bought myself a PQ and a couple of Snickers bars, and returned to the stoop to wait. I had my camera with me, so I took it out of my pocket and started filming the street scenes taking place five steps down from where I was sitting. There was an old lady pushing an even older shopping cart filled with winter clothing, and a skinny hairless guy yelling into a mouthpiece, and two kids a couple of years younger than me walking about six dogs between them. Put everyone in the frame and it made a great shot. I couldnt wait to show my dad the footage.</div><div class="tx">I looked at my cell phone: Speaking of my dad, where <i>was</i> he? His phone was switched off, so I decided to get up and ring the bell again. He was a pretty heavy sleeper,  and it really wasnt like him to forget about me for this long. I wondered if maybe I should call my mom? But no, no, shed completely freak, and what could she do about it, anyway? Id rather spend the whole weekend alone on this stoop than under the watchful glare of Evelyn.</div><div class="tx">Id just returned from my second trip to the bodega when I ran smack into my dad on the bottom step of his stoop. Oh, hey, B-Ball man! Whatre you doing here?</div><div class="tx">He was in work clothesjeans and a dirty, sweat-stained button-downand carrying a six-pack of beer in a plastic bag. He still had his work goggles around his neck, and he looked completely exhausted, like the last thing he wanted to do was hang out with his thirteen-year-old son yet again.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_010_r1.jpg" alt="010" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">What do you mean? Didnt Mom call you last night? Id been in the room at the time so I knew for a fact that shed called him. I mean, she, like, got roped into doing double or triple shifts all weekend, so shed . . .</div><div class="tx">My dad put the six-pack down on the top step and struck his forehead. Shit, son, of course she did. Totally slipped my mind, sorry about that. But you know Im used to your coming here on Saturdays. A little break in my routine, thats allit just takes a little adjusting. Lucky we both got here at the same time, though, huh?</div><div class="tx">I glanced down at my camera, then shoved it in my pocket. Yeah, I said. Real lucky.</div><div class="tx">Yo, so listen, I was gonna see Diane later on, but Im too beat anyway. Let me just call her and cancel, all right? he said as I followed him up the dark staircase. You feel like hitting another movie tonight?</div><div class="tx">Of course I wanted to hit another movie, but I didnt want to push it, not when I had a much bigger favor to ask of my dad that weekend. Youre sure youre not too tired?</div><div class="tx">Nah, boy, you know I can sleep anywhere.</div><div class="tx">After a quick shower and change of clothes, my dad and I headed back downstairs. It was totally dark by the time we made it outside. Before getting on the train, we stopped off for some pizza.</div><div class="tx">We were waiting on the downtown platform, both of us with a slice of pepperoni in each hand, when I decided to ask my dad about the sneakers. Hey, Dad? I asked, and he nodded between chews. Can I ask you a big favor, do you mind? And you can say no; I swear I wont care. Its just, well ... You see these shoes Im wearing? Well, theyre sort of old and shit, and I dont know . . .</div><div class="tx">Id had a whole speech prepared, but it turned out I didnt need it. You want some new kicks, my man, is that what youre getting at? Hell, yes, those there are looking nasty. Ill hook you up. Well hit the shops tomorrowyou want to swing by Atmos first, dont you?</div><div class="tx">The whole ride down to 125<sup>th</sup> Street, I felt like my face was going to split in two from grinning. I couldnt believe I was finally getting me some new shoes! My dad really was the bomb. Man, Andres and Darrell and Bobbie have probably never seen the kind of merchandise they sell at Atmos. Not even the most tripped-out store in the suburbs could touch that shit.</div><div class="tx">When we were in line for the tickets, my dad mustve  seen me tapping my feet and staring down at my raggedy X Series because he said, Oh, but one thing, boy. Ill only get you the shoes under one condition.</div><div class="tx">My heart sank right through the shredded-up soles of my shoes. Yeah, whats that, Dad?</div><div class="tx">Your mom called me in the middle of the night last night, at God knows what timedoesnt that woman know some of us work for a living? I think thats why I forgot you were coming today because I was damn near dead asleep when she called. Anyway, she filled me in on some of the shit thats been going down with you at school. I knew youd been suspended and shit, but this was the first time she took it upon herself to really acquaint me with all the dirty details.</div><div class="tx">Ah, I said, or maybe I just thought it. Id been wondering when Mom would get around to this. She was too shy to come right out and confront me about the whole Maurice situation, but she knew my dad wouldnt mind kicking my ass hard.</div><div class="tx">I was scrambling to come up with some excuse for why Id done what Id done. But how could I defend myself without getting into the real nitty-gritty? My dad was the last person on the planet I wanted knowing my business. I mean, hed just lose it completely.</div><div class="tx">Heres the thing, man, my dad was saying. Its cool what you did, you know? A man has his reasons and I respect that. In fact, I was kind of proud of you when she told memaybe youre not such a worthless fatass after all, you know? But theres just one problem, my brother, and its a big one.</div><div class="tx">He paused; I tried to catch my breath. It was taking me a while to process what my dad was saying. What exactly <i>was</i> he saying?</div><div class="tx">You shouldnt have gotten caught, Butterball, man. I mean, what were you thinking?</div><div class="tx">What? My head snapped up. What does <i>that</i> mean?</div><div class="tx">Like I said, its fine to settle scores, but you cant do that shit on the playground with your gym coach and great-aunt Liza watching and shit. I mean, what the hell? Thats a good guarantee of getting stopped before you finish the job, you know what Im saying? You want respect, you write your own rules. Thats why you gotta go a little incognito from time to time, know what I mean?</div><div class="tx">I thought of Nias party, just a week away now. With her mom gone for the night, some crazy shit was gonna go down whether I showed up or not. You mean like at a party? I asked carefully.</div><div class="tx">Thats what Im talking about. Thats where you can get the respect without the restraints.</div><div class="tx">But what if . . . I hesitated, then went ahead and explained the whole complicated Bobbie-Terrence situation to my dad. . . . So yeah, he took this friend of mines girl, but that was a while ago. And now it sounds like hes got this other chick in his sightsthis girl Nia, whos always been real nice to me. So Andres and the other guys, they all say I should punish Terrence for messing with women that dont belong to him.</div><div class="tx">Well, shit yeah, you should. No mofo can expect to take another mans lady from him and just get away with that shit. That just aint how the world works.</div><div class="tx">I guess I hadnt explained myself right. Butbut I dont even know the guy, I said. Ive never even laid eyes on him. He took this friend of mines girl, not mine.</div><div class="tx">So? A guy stealing someone elses girlthat just aint cool. You and your friend, youve got a responsibility to show that dude whats what.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, but, I mean, shouldnt Bobbie be the one who does it? I mean, hes the one whose girl got stolen, not mine.</div><div class="tx">Depends, my dad said. Depends who wants the  respect more, and who needs it more. You show people youre a force to reckon with, and I promise you shitll start falling into place for you. Who knowsyou might even get yourself a girl, and any brother with titties like yours is gonna need as much help as he can get in that department. My dad thought this was pretty funny.</div><div class="tx">My cheeks were burning, and I decided to let the subject drop. I looked around me. The line was taking forever, but I guess thats what you get for showing up at nine P.M. on a Friday without tickets. I shifted from one foot to the other and wished Id never mentioned Bobbie and Terrence to my dad. But at least he hadnt said anything more about not getting me the shoes.</div><div class="tx">Here, Ill show you what I mean, boy. You want the world to treat you like a man, you gotta start acting like one. Its really just a question of getting what you want in your sights and just grabbing it. Now just watch and learn.</div><div class="tx">With that, my dad stepped out of the line and strolled right past the eight or so people who were waiting between us and the ticket counter. At the very front of the line, he edged past a young guy and his girlfriend and said to the woman, Well have two tickets forthen, turning back to me, he shoutedwhat was it you wanted to see, B-Ball?</div><div class="tx">Uh<i>Source Code</i>, I squeaked out. All the people between me and the front of the line were grumbling and squawking and turning around to glare at me, but I just kept my eyes on my nasty old shoes.</div><div class="tx">Hey, whats up with that? the guy whod been at the very front of the line protested, tapping my dad on the shoulder. Thats not cool, man. You just took our place in line.</div><div class="tx">My dad whipped around and stuck his face right up close to the guys. He flinched and took a step back.</div><div class="tx">Oh, yeah? Dad said threateningly. Well, looks like its my place now, dont it?</div><div class="tx">Thatll be twenty-one dollars, the woman in the ticket booth said, and my dad had the cash ready. He took the tickets andafter giving the guy whod yelled at him a little shovewalked back to where I still stood frozen in place.</div><div class="tx">See what Im talking about, B-ball? Now <i>thats</i> how a man gets it done.</div></body></html>';

I couldnt decide whether I should mention the shoes again. My dad always had good intentions, and when he made a promise he stuck to it. But he could also be pretty forgetful, especially when he was working a lot and tired all the time like he was now.</div><div class="tx">But as it turned out, my dad hadnt forgotten his promise at all. You still want to get some new lugs? he asked me only about a block south of his apartment.</div><div class="tx">Yeah! I said. Yeah, Dad, thatd be so cool! I needem so bad, you really dont even know!</div><div class="tx">Calm down, calm down, boy, were going.</div><div class="tx">And so after grabbing some more pizza, we caught the train down to 125<sup>th</sup> Street, then walked the half-block to Atmos, which was like a giant cathedral filled top to bottom with the coolest sneakers on earth.</div><div class="tx">We hadnt walked two steps into the store before my eyes landed right on the Air Foamposites display, arranged in a tall pyramid at the center of the room. They even had them in cobalt blue. They were the most beautiful shoes Id ever seen and then some. I swear if I were rich, Id own a different color for every day of the week.</div><div class="tx">So which ones you like, B-Ball? my dad asked, following my eyes to the Foamposites. We walked over to the pyramid, and he pointed to the cobalt shoes at the very top. These?</div><div class="tx">Yeah, but . . . There are a lot of cool shoes in here, I said, quickly scrambling to come up with less pricey alternatives. My dad wasnt a cheap-ass like my mom, but the man wasnt made of money, either. I knew those Foamposites could run upward of three hundred dollars, and even more for the limited-edition colors like the cobalt. There were tons of other cool shoes Id be happy to wear, like the Air Jordan XIs in red or the all-black Lebron VIIIs. Even the cheapest shoe in the store would  look better than my old X Series.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, but why settle? my dad asked. Remember what I said last night? You get what you want in your sights, and you go for it. You dont let nothing get in your way.</div><div class="tx">Uh-huh, but I can always</div><div class="tx">My dad was already shouting at a kid in an Atmos T-shirt. Hey, cmere! You work here? We want to try us on some of these shoes.</div><div class="tx">The kid nodded approvingly, then asked me my size. I had no idea, I told him; I couldnt remember the last time Id actually tried on new shoes.</div><div class="tx">So while my dad cruised around the store, pulling shoes off their display shelves and not always returning them, the boyhis name tag said Rodneysat me down and measured my foot real methodically.</div><div class="tx">I was a size 10, which meant Id grown two whole sizes since Id bought my X Series. So yeah, I wasnt being a brat or anything. It really was time I got myself some new shoes. The knock-offs my mom was always trying to buy me at Payless didnt count.</div><div class="tx">The kid picked up the shoes Id just taken off, their leather worn so thin on the sides it was almost see-through in places, and grinned appreciatively. These  shoes are classics, man, he said, trying not to notice how worn-down they were on the bottom. I can see why youd want to hang onto them.</div><div class="tx">I grinned back. This guy was pretty cool.</div><div class="tx">You got any color preferences for the Foamposites? he asked as he got up.</div><div class="tx">Whatever you got, I said, but I sure wouldnt mind looking at the cobalts.</div><div class="tx">He came back with the cobalt box open on top of the stack, so of course I couldnt help trying those on first. They fit me perfectly. I took a few steps around the store, and I swear it felt like walking on a mattress. Everything was so squishy and soft and cushioned.</div><div class="tx">These the ones? my dad said, coming over to me as I pulled the shoes off and sifted through the boxes for a more basic color.</div><div class="tx">I like them, sure, but there are a lot of other cool ones around, I said. I saw some nice Air Jordans over there. Those might not be limited-edition, but they couldnt possibly cost more than $150.</div><div class="tx">You want to try those, too? my dad said.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, sure, I said, gazing down at the Foamposites on the bench. It sounds crazy to say this about a pair  of shoes, but they really were just incredibly beautifulthe way a sunset or the last shot of <i>Planet of the Apes</i>, the original I mean, not that remake shit, the way it cuts from the beach to that wide shot of the Statue of Liberty, <i>thats</i> beautiful.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_011_r1.jpg" alt="011" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">All right, go bring us some of the Air Jordans, too, my dad told Rodney.</div><div class="tx">As soon as Rodney disappeared behind the velvet curtain, my dad leaned down toward me and said in a low voice, Remember what I told you last night? About deciding what you want and just going for it? I nodded, and he went on, You act like youre in charge, then youre in charge. Its as simple as that. Now Ill see you back at home, sound good?</div><div class="tx">As he spoke, my dad stooped down even more, plucked up the shoes Id just tried on, and just like that  he walked calmly out of the store. <i>What the?</i></div><div class="tx">I figured it out just about two seconds before Rodney came out of the storeroom, which didnt give me much of a headstart. The next few seconds are a blur in my memory. Rodney looked at my face, then at the empty spot on the bench where the shoes had been, and then out the plate-glass front of the store. My dad was nowhere to be seen, and just as Rodney let out a shout, my panic button went off. I jumped off that bench anddespite the fact that I had only old socks on my feetI hauled ass right on out of there.</div><div class="tx">By now an alarm bell was buzzing, and Rodney was hurling himself at me as if in slow motion. But for the first time in my life, I was faster than anyone, and I streaked up 125<sup>th</sup> Street like my survival depended on it. And maybe it did. Even barefoot like I was, I ran uptown as fast as Id ever run in my life, but still it was seven whole blocks before I caught up with my dad. I was panting and sweating and as close as Ive ever been to a heart attack, but by then I was safe. Id beat Rodney and all the rest of them, and no one could ever take those shoes off me again. They were mine. Id earned them fair and square.</div></body></html>';

You have fun in the city? Darrell asked me, and instead of answering I just stuck out my feet.</div><div class="tx">Whoa, those are nice! Everyone gathered around to admire my Foamposites; a couple of guys even got up to inspect them up close. I had the whole tables attention, and I remembered what my dad had said about getting what I wanted in my sights and then just going for it. He could be wise sometimes, my dad.</div><div class="tx">Bobbie let out a whistle. Oh, man, and you got them in the cobalt, too? Arent those, like, limited edition and shit?</div><div class="tx">Sure are. Like I said, Ive just been waiting for them to come out. Not just any shoes are good enough for these feet.</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">I didnt see any reason to mention the blaring security alarm and all the sweat dripping down my face by the time I finally spotted the backside of my dad strolling casually up Seventh Avenue. I didnt stop running until I was right up there next to him, panting like I was on the verge of a heart attack, every inch of me stinky and sore.</div><div class="tx">When he saw me, dad clapped me on the back and told me he was proud of me for making it out of there alive: Very nice work, boy, and I mean no disrespect, but no kid your age should be panting like a dog after running half a block. And then, before he even handed over the shoes, he just broke out laughing. Oh, man, look at you! If you could only see yourself, boy, god<i>damn</i>!</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">Your pops must have some deep pockets, Darrell said.</div><div class="tx">He does all right for himself, I said with a shrug.</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">I didnt feel any need to describe the look on that nice salesguy Rodneys face when, a little too late, he figured out what my dad had done, or how my heart seemed to  stop beating for a full minute as I jumped to my feet and made tracks out of that store as fast as these piggy legs could carry me.</div><div class="tx">Nah, I just shoved another chicken tender into my mouth, stuck my feet out, and said, Check em out, right. Only two stores in the whole country carry these shoes. The rest are all in Japan.</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">None of the boys could see the thousands of little cuts and blisters covering the bottoms of my feet from running over all those ripped sidewalks and tramping over broken bottles and stray twigs and sharp little pebbles. No one could see the little circles of blood on the insole of my brand-new Foamposites from the fifteen-block walk back to dads place once he finally handed over my new shoes. Nobody needed to hear about how my dad couldnt stop cracking up the whole way home, saying, Oh, man, you shouldve seen the look on your face when I walked on out of there. Man, Id do it all over again just to get a picture of that shit. Im telling you, it was classic. And then to see your blubbery ass jiggling all the way up Seventh Avenue like that! Man, maybe I shouldve borrowed your video camera to make some cinema out of that shit!</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_012_r1.jpg" alt="012" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">After a few minutes of ooh-ing and ah-ing, I put my feet under the table and finished up my lunch. I think next time Im getting them in that ice-silver color theyve got, I said, and Andres and the rest of them looked at me with real respect.</div><div class="tx">Youre sure gonna tear it up at Nias place on Saturday, Andres said with a smile. No shorty can resist shoes like that. I shrugged but didnt say anything.</div><div class="tx">After lunch I stopped off at the bathroom on my way to math class. I almost never came to this bathroom anymore, but Id stayed at lunch too long and was in a hurry. Mrs. Fleming was real anal about tardiness, and I didnt want to make my whole academic probation situation any worse than necessary.</div><div class="tx">The bathroom was in the same hall as my seventh-grade homeroom, a smelly-ass reminder of all those hours Id spent locked inside the handicapped stall the year before, just counting down the minutes till lunch period was up. That was before I got comfortable around good ol J. Watkins.</div><div class="tx">I was at the urinal, just about finished with my business, when these two little kids who were always trying to take over my lunch table walked in. They looked scared  when they saw me, and they damn well shouldve been. I zipped up and clapped my hands together nice and loud as the two of them backed toward the door.</div><div class="tx">Whats the problem, guys? I asked, and before they could escape back into the hall, I crossed the room real fast and shoved myself right up into their faces. I dont know why seeing them made me so angry all of a sudden. Maybe it was because they reminded me of what Maurice and I had been like the year before: pathetic losers. Or maybe it was because I had the shoes nowand the status that went with them. Or maybe I didnt need any damn reason.</div><div class="tx">You guys following me around or something? I asked when neither of them answered. Jamal looked like he was about to piss himself right through his pants. Shit was mad funny.</div><div class="tx">N-no, of course were not, the bigger one said. No idea what his name was. He was fat like me, and he always had that kid Jamal next to him like some sort of miniature bodyguard.</div><div class="tx">Youd better not be, I said. Because if I see your ugly faces around here again, Im gonna get all kinds of mad. I leaned an inch forward until I was right in the fat kids face. Youd best be checking yourselves from now  on if you know whats good for you.</div><div class="tx">I slammed the kid against the door and in the same second pushed it open. As I shoved past him to go back into the hall, the kid fell flat on his ass right on the nasty bathroom floor.</div><div class="tx">Sucker.</div></body></html>';

I needed to soak my feet or get some ointment or something when I got home, but I didnt want my mom or, even worse, Evelyn, to ask any questions about the condition of my feet.</div><div class="tx">Not that either of them ever paid close enough attention to me for that, but still, I wasnt about to take any chances. I knew my mom would kill my dad dead if shed had any clue what wed done over the weekend. He hadnt even had to swear me to secrecy. Hed known I wasnt dumb enough to rat him out like that. Besides, my  mom was already good and pissed about the new shoes, which I wouldve stashed under my bed if I hadnt left my backup pair on the floor of Atmos NYC.</div><div class="tx">I was feeling pretty lowdown when I tromped up that dark stairwell to Lizs office, and Id be lying if I said she wasnt about the last person on earth I wanted to see right then. Okay, third to last maybe, but definitely in the bottom five.</div><div class="tx">Howre you doing today? she asked me as I plopped down onto her nasty brown couch.</div><div class="tx">I shrugged, then suddenly remembered how shed booted me out of there early on Friday. Did you have a nice weekend? I asked, widening my eyes at her.</div><div class="tx">Liz straightened up a little. She clearly didnt appreciate having the tables turned on her like that. I did, thanks.</div><div class="tx">I raised my left eyebrow at her. I was really enjoying watching the old lady squirm. Good times Friday night, huh?</div><div class="tx">She narrowed her eyes at me. I suppose so. Why do you ask? Youve never taken much interest before. Why now?</div><div class="tx">I shrugged. I wouldnt say Im interested, I said. Just making conversation, whats wrong with that? Since when are you the only one allowed to ask questions around here? I settled back into the couch and kicked my shoes onto the  little coffee table between me and Liz. It relieved the pressure on my feet, so I kept them up there and pretended not to notice the stern look the coffee tables owner was shooting me. Oh, and while Im at it, Liz, would you mind if I asked you a personal question? You dont have to answer if you dont feel like it. I just kinda feel like asking.</div><div class="tx">By now she was practically sweating bullets. It was classic. <i>Not so fun, is it, Liz, when the microscope gets turned on you?</i> I . . . suppose so, she said finally.</div><div class="tx">All right, then, here goes. You got a boyfriend or a husband or any-thing like that, a special someone who makes you feel all nice inside?</div><div class="tx">And here Liz straightened up so tall it was like there was a gun to her head. I dont really see how thats any of your business, she said sharply.</div><div class="tx">Well, you said I could ask, I pointed out, and thats all I was doing. Anyway, you asked me pretty much the same thing the first time we met.</div><div class="tx">Yes, but . . . Liz was looking at me with a serious expression. All right, then, I guess thats true. So yes, as a matter of fact, I am seeing someone at the moment. And we did go out on Friday night, as you so cleverly intuited. We went to Connecticut, actually, to a little bed-and-breakfast by the water.</div><div class="tx">That sounds hot, I said with maximum sarcasm, but I was actually feeling kind of fond of old Liz for letting me in like that. And, I gotta admit, I was a little proud of her, too. So she had herself a man, did she? Good for her.</div><div class="tx">Ive never stayed in a hotel before, I said when it became clear that Liz wasnt happy with my first response. Must be nice. She kept on giving me the silent treatment, so I went on, I thought I was going to when my grandma died a few years back, since there were so many other relatives coming into Philly for the burial and all. But I ended up just sleeping on the floor of her tiny living room with all my cousins. It was real fun, way better than any hotel. Kinda made me wish I had some brothers and sisters of my own, you know? Seems like everyone else has that, but not ol Butterball.</div><div class="tx">Has what? Liz asked when I broke off. Siblings, you mean?</div><div class="tx">I shrugged. Yeah, I guess. Or not exactly that, but . . . you know, just someone to hang with whenever you wanted. Like, someone close to your own age who isnt too busy for you and had to stick it out with you no matter what. My dad always said hed wanted a shitload of kids, but my mom put the brakes on his plans. She denies  it, of course, says its because we were broke as shit back then and my dad was never around. But Ill bet you anything my moms the one whos lying. Its just like her to be all selfish about something like that. Even one kids a little too much for her to deal with most of the time, you know?</div><div class="tx">Suddenly I noticed the wide-eyed way Liz was looking at me. She was craned all the way forward, staring at me like I was an exhibit at the science museum or some shit like that. At the same moment, I felt the warm trickle of tears down the side of my face. <i>WTFwhat was</i> that <i>about?</i> Somehow Liz had conned me into ... But forget it. No way was I gonna give her the pleasure. After the fight my mom and I had had on Sunday, I never wanted to talk about that woman again. But I wasnt going to tell Liz about that fight.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_013_r1.jpg" alt="013" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">I sat up real straight in my chair and flicked my eyes over to my new shoes on Lizs coffee table. They were the finest items in that whole shitty room.</div><div class="tx">But my dads like the opposite, you know? I said in my regular voice again. Hes not selfish at all. Hed do just about anything for me; all I have to do is ask. Like I said, hes the best damn dad in the world. My life would be perfect if I could just go live with him full-time again. And somehow, the more I spoke, the less I could stop the flow of tears down my face. If only my dad could see his fatass wimp of a son now, man, hed just be thrilled.</div><div class="tx">What time is it? I asked. Aint it about time you and I wrapped up?</div><div class="tx">Liz slowly lifted her arm and squinted at her old-fashioned wristwatch. Then she shook her head. No, Im sorry to say that you havent even been here twenty minutes, she said, but she didnt sound sorry at all. Can weId like, if you dont mind, to return to what  you were saying earlier about your mom beingwhat was the word you used? She pretended to glance at the notebook next to her. Selfish, I believe you said. Would you care to elaborate a little on that point?</div><div class="tx">No, I dont care to elaborate on that point, I mimicked in the squeakiest old-white-woman voice I could manage. My eyes were dry now, and I knew exactly where I was and what I was doing there.</div><div class="tx">All right then. Liz seemed unfazed. I justI mean, if you dont mind if I make an observation. Well, it seems to me that your mother isnt all that selfish. I dont know her well personally, of course, but on paper, well, it seems like your mother has sacrificed a great deal for you. Moving out here, to a safer neighborhood and better school district, working so hard for her nursing degree so she can better provide</div><div class="tx">Lets get some stuff straight, lady, I cut in angrily. I just wasnt in the mood for any of Lizs BS. The only true thing you said just now is that you dont know my mother all that well. Thats what Id call the biggest understatement ever because you dont know her at <i>all</i>. On paperwhat does that even mean, anyway? And, by the way, there was nothing wrong with my old school or my old neighborhood in the city. I was happy living there,  just like I was happy living with my dad. My mom packed us up and moved us out to this shithole for one reason and one reason alone: because <i>she</i> wanted to. Thats the only reason shes ever done anything in her whole life, so I dont want to hear your ass lecturing me about all the damn sacrifices shes made on my behalf. Shes never done jack shit for me. Do you understand me? So Im done talking about her, done.</div><div class="tx">I broke off, a little short of breath, and when I looked over at Liz I realized Id done it again: Id played right into that womans hands. She was smiling and nodding over and over as those stupid-ass tears kept rolling one after the other down my face.</div></body></html>';

I mean, yeah, we barely ever talked anymore, but she was still my mom, you know? But that Sunday after my visit to the city, she sure didnt waste any time bursting my bubble.</div><div class="tx">Your father didnt tell me he was getting you new shoes.</div><div class="tx">Those were the first words out of her mouth after I slid into her car right outside the train station. She hadnt even said hello to me yet or asked me if Id had a fun weekend in the city, but at least I was glad she was  too tired to notice how Id hobbled all the way to the car.</div><div class="tx">So? I was staring straight ahead of me. Hes gotta ask your permission for everything he want to do? Didnt you give up those rights when you kicked his ass to the curb?</div><div class="tx">My mom exhaled noisily. Thats not what I meant and you know it. I was just making an observation.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, well, even if he had asked, Im sure you wouldnt have remembered. Youve been pretty busy lately, I couldnt help noticing.</div><div class="tx">My mom made another huffing sound and shot me a tired not-this-again look. Well, she was the one whod started it.</div><div class="tx">How much did those shoes cost? she asked me about half a second later. Im just curious.</div><div class="tx">I looked out the grimy window of her used Honda, which sputtered every time she pumped on the brakes. No idea, I said. He told me I could pick out anything I wanted, so I did. Hes real cool that way, Dad is. Always has been.</div><div class="tx">I could hear my moms quick angry breaths from across the car. Well, that was very generous of him, she said, especially since hes three months late on his payments.</div><div class="tx">Mom, dont you be talking to me about his payments again. You <i>know</i> its none of my business. Besides, Dads been picking up a lot of slack from you lately.</div><div class="tx">And beyond that, she went on, as if not having heard me, I have a real problem with your father rewarding you forfor . . .</div><div class="tx">Even now she couldnt bring herself to say the words kicking that poor nerds ass out loud. Instead she mumbled quietly to herself, as if I werent right there next to her, I told him you were grounded and <i>this</i> is what he does? I swear, every single thing I do, that man tries to undermine.</div><div class="tx">You have no idea, I murmured, looking down at my Foamposites.</div><div class="tx">What was that? she snapped at me.</div><div class="tx">Nothing, I said quickly.</div><div class="tx">You <i>know</i> I wont have you cursing at me under your breath, young man. You know perfectly well thats never been something Ive tolerated.</div><div class="tx">Man, she was worked up, and we werent even halfway back from the train station yet. There were big pockets under her eyes from what was probably another long weekend at work. I was feeling pretty tired myself, so I figured Id better turn down the volume a little. I  wasnt cursing, Ma, I said, then added to be safe, I promise you. I was just saying thatwell, I mean, I really needed to get me some new shoes, so I just asked Dad for a little early birthday present, thats all.</div><div class="tx">Four months is pretty early, she said. And I still dont understand what was wrong with the shoes <i>I</i> got you. Theyre perfectly nice, and they look identical to all the other sneakers youre always going on about.</div><div class="tx">And though I was doing my best to keep the peace, I just couldnt let this one slide. They dont look <i>anything</i> alike, Ma. How many times do I have to tell you? No one in his right mind would wear those ugly-ass Payless rip-offs in public, not even in this retarded town.</div><div class="tx">Dont you dare curse at me, young man!</div><div class="tx">Relax, Ma, I wasnt cursing <i>at</i></div><div class="tx">But it was too late. My mom usually kept a tight lid on her emotions, but when she got pissed, she got <i>pissed</i>. No way I could bring her down easily now. And what does that mean, anyway, you <i>need</i> new shoes? she practically yelled across the car. Whats so important all of a sudden that youve gotta waste money your dad doesnt have on shoes that look just like ones you already have?</div><div class="tx">I knew Id have to ask her sooner or later, and now seemed as good a time as any, since otherwise there was  no way she or Evelyn would let me out on Saturday night. Who knows if my mom and I would get a chance to talk between now and then? Because, I burst out, a good friend of mine is having a party next weekend, and I really, <i>really</i> want to go. And I wanted to look good, you know?</div><div class="tx">You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me. My mom shook her head furiously, but I could tell she was a little bit intrigued. Party was not a word Id said much since moving out to Garden City, and neither was friend.</div><div class="tx">What kind of party? she asked after shed exhaled through her nostrils a few times. Then, in case I got my hopes up, she added quickly, And what kind of fool child on academic probation, just one step away from having his very own police record, thinks Id let him go to a party?</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_014_r1.jpg" alt="014" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">Aw, cmon, Mom, I really want to go. This real nice girl Nia is turning fourteen, and all the other kids will be there. Shes one of the nicest kids at school, and, and . . .</div><div class="tx">Was she really going to make me fill in the rest for her? That I hadnt been invited to a party or anything like it in the two long, gloomy years since wed moved out to this dump?</div><div class="tx">Mom heard the crack in my voice and seemed to waver, but not for long. No way, no how, she said, or not unless I can get this Nias mother on the phone to tell me about the party herself. Until you learn the difference between right and wrong, you aint going anywhere until I say so.</div><div class="tx">Tears sprang to the corners of my eyes. What a perfect end to my weekend in the city. I could <i>not</i> believe my mother would actually do this to me. Id tried to play it positive with her, to let her in a little, but there was just no winning with her. Ever since my week off school, when shed had to take off all those days from work, she just hadnt stopped making me pay, pay, pay. It wasnt right. I hadnt asked for any of this.</div><div class="tx">You know what, I think its real rich, having you of all people lecturing me about the difference between right and wrong, I said quietly as my mom pulled into the parking lot behind our building.</div><div class="tx">She slammed hard on the brake, and the hands gripping the steering wheel were shaking. Me of all people? she practically yelled. And what, pray tell, is that supposed to mean?</div><div class="tx">I could tell that Id gotten her good. She whipped around to stare at me, but I was gone. I faced the passenger-side window and just fixed my eyes on the depressing Dumpster where I had to lug the trash every Tuesday night. If I didnt, the garbage would just pile up rotting inside our apartment till the cops came by looking for a corpse.</div><div class="tx">You know exactly what I mean, I said quietly as I unbuckled my seatbelt and grabbed my bag. Try figuring out your own messed-up life first. Then maybe you can start in on mine.</div><div class="tx">And with that I yanked the car door open and got out. My mom didnt try to stop me. She just sat there behind the steering wheel, gazing blankly at the now-empty passenger seat beside her. She looked like shed just been socked in the stomach, and that was perfectly all right with me.</div></body></html>';

She didnt even mention my mom again, which I have to say was cool of her. Do you mind if I ask you about something else, Butterball? she asked after maybe five minutes had passed.</div><div class="tx">I lifted my shoulders but didnt say anything.</div><div class="tx">All right then, Liz said with that devious calmness of hers. Its no big deal. I really just wanted to ask you about that little camera you always carry around with you.</div><div class="tx">Huh? Even though I messed around with my video camera on the walk over to Lizs, I was always careful  to stash it back in my backpack on my walk up the dark staircase to her office. Howd she seen it?</div><div class="tx">I just find it interesting that youve never mentioned it to me, Liz went on without explaining herself. Do you have a photography class in school?</div><div class="tx">I grunted at this. A <i>photography</i> class? At <i>Watkins?</i> LadyLizwhatre you smoking? Have you ever <i>seen</i> J. Watkins? Its only a couple of blocks away; you should go have a look sometime. That place is about as likely to have a heated swimming pool as a photo class.</div><div class="tx">Liz smiled. Thats very funny, Butterball. You have a wonderful sense of humor, do you know that?</div><div class="tx">I grunted again but kept my mouth shut. Clearly my moment of weakness a few minutes earlier had given ol Liz a false sense of intimacy with me.</div><div class="tx">Can you tell me about the camera then? she pressed. Can I see it?</div><div class="tx">I pulled my backpack closer to me and shook my head. What was this womans problem, anyway? I still didnt understand how she even knew about the camera in the first place, much less why she wanted to see it. Nah, its just a camera, I said. And if you were going to check to see if it was hot, it isnt. I still have the receipt and everything, just in case it breaks and I gotta get it repaired or something.</div><div class="tx">Oh, now, Butterball, I wasnt implying anything like that! Liz exclaimed, and she seemed genuinely shocked by my suggestion. I just ... I dont know. Im just interested in what interests you, thats all.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, right.</div><div class="tx">Soon enough Liz took another approach. You like going to the movies, dont you? she asked. You said thats the thing you enjoy doing most with your dad?</div><div class="tx">Whats so wacked about that? Lots of kids like going to the movies.</div><div class="tx">Nothing at all, Liz said. It was just a question. So whats your favorite movie, would you say?</div><div class="tx">I shrugged. I dont know. I like a lot of the comic-book adaptations theyve been doing lately, like with special effects but not <i>only</i> special effects, also real actors. You know what I mean?</div><div class="tx">I think so. Is there any reason those movies have a special appeal, do you think?</div><div class="tx">Does there always have to be a <i>reason</i> for shit? I asked. I was glad I hadnt told Liz about the other movies I was intothe foreign, artsy shit. It wasnt that I was embarrassed or anything like that, just that Liz was a classic give-an-inch-take-a-mile type, and I didnt want to give her any extra openings. I mean, why cant I ever  just like what I like? I like comic books and graphic novels and shit like that, too, though Id never really gotten into them until . . . Until I got to know Maurice, but I saw no reason to go into all that detail. Anyway, I like reading all that stuff and trying to figure out how itd work on the screen, know what Im saying?</div><div class="tx">I felt a little more chill now. Movies, that was a safe topic for me, comfortable territory. I still remember the first movie I ever saw in a theater, I told Liz. I was like six or seven, I think, and my parents and Ithey were still together back then, you know. Anyway, wed gone down to Philly to visit my grandma, who was already pretty sick, and one night when the whole apartment was filled up with people, my mom just decided to take me out, just for the hell of it. I dont know where my dad was or why he didnt come, but yeah. It was real cool of hershe never does shit like that. <i>Especially not anymore</i>, I didnt add.</div><div class="tx">The movie was <i>Batman Begins</i>, and man, I couldnt even believe how much I loved that shit, like every second of it. I still remember sitting in the dark like that, and thinking how cool it was that no one could see me or tell what I was thinking or even who I was, which I still think is just the coolest feeling in the world. Like I could  be anyone, you know? If I stayed in the dark long enough or concentrated hard enough, I could be up there on that screen, too. To be able to make someone else feel that way, I mean, it just blew my mind.</div><div class="tx">So thats what you want to do then? Liz said. Make movies?</div><div class="tx">I grunted for like the tenth time that hour. Yeah, and Id also like to go swimming on Jupiter, I said, but that dont mean either of those things is ever gonna happen.</div><div class="tx">Oh, now, Butterball, I wouldnt say that, Liz said. If you believe in yourself, you know . . .</div><div class="tx">Later on, I went on, cutting Liz off, when I was at the library at school, I looked Batman up and ended up finding out a bunch of shit about the guy whod made the latest adaptation. Christopher Nolan, thats his name. I was interested, you know? He was like my opposite in every wayfrom England, and rich and snooty and all the shit youd expect, the kind of guy whod cross to the other side of the street if he saw me coming. But one thing really stuck out for me, and that was that this cat made his first movie when he was seven years old. Isnt that crazy? I mean it was the same age I was then, and that brother had already made a movie? Man. Hed found some camera in his dads garage and just gone to  town with it, and from that point on he always knew hed make movies one day. Cool, isnt it, knowing something like that?</div><div class="tx">It <i>is</i> cool, Liz said, but I barely knew she was there anymore.</div><div class="tx">My parents didnt have jack shit in their garage because they didnt even have a garage, but my birthday was coming up. So I worked up the courage to ask them for help getting a little camera of my own. My mom said yes, I could have one, but Id have to earn it. Typical of my mom, but I wanted it so bad that I agreed to everything she said. Shed started this little system where Id get a quarter every time I made my bed in the morning or cleaned up the plates after breakfast or whatever. I put all the money in this old lunch box I kept on the bureau in my bedroom, and at the end of every week Id count up what Id earned and try to figure out how much longer Id have to wait before I could score a movie camera of my own.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_015_r1.jpg" alt="015" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">Liz was no longer trying to interrupt, and that was just fine by me. Man, it seemed like forever ago when I first started stashing quarters in that old Batman lunchbox of mine, which Id had since kindergarten.</div><div class="tx">Id saved up almost a hundred bucksit was eighty-nine dollars, to be exactwhen one afternoon, my dad came home from work with a brand-new flip cam for me. My mom was so pissed off and went off on him for refusing to teach me the value of hard work, blah, blah, blah, but for once I didnt care. I was just the happiest fool in the whole world that day, you know? I mean, I think it was probably the best day of my life when I held that camera in my hands for the first time. I had my very own movie-making machine <i>and</i> a drawer full of quarters that added up to almost a hundred bucks, you know? Just try and stop me. But anyway, I never ended up spending that money, or not for a long time. I just kept on saving it up, and two years later, when my flip cam got jacked on the 2 train, I didnt even care. It was a piece of shit, anyway, and by that point Id saved enough quarters to hit J&amp;R and get any damn camera I wanted. Thats the camera I have nowa Panasonic ultrathin pocket camcorder. I paid for it with my own money, and it still works great. You can, like, edit right on it and everything, dont even need a computer or anything, not that Id mind having a computer, of course.</div><div class="tx">When I finally broke off talking, I saw that Liz had a totally stoked look on her face. <i>Oh, man, Id done it again, hadnt I?</i> Shed tricked me twice in one session. What time is it now? I asked suddenly. You said twenty minutes had passed like three hours ago. Its gotta be jailbreak time by now, huh?</div><div class="tx">Liz looked at her watch and gave a little jump. Oh, my, youre right! Weve gone about twenty minutes over. I hope this doesnt affect your afternoon.</div><div class="tx">Nah, its cool, I said, but damn was I relieved to be getting to my feet. Liz got up with me. I already knew I was her last appointment of the day.</div></body></html>';

Definitely something suspicious going on.</div><div class="tx">I winced. Whyd my mom always have to be flip-flopping between such extremes like that?</div><div class="tx">You ran over quite a bit in there, didnt you? she said, but her voice wasnt accusatory like it usually was when I was making her late. Not that its a problem. I  mean, I got here a little late myself, and I was just a little worried out there in the parking lot. But then I came inside and heard your voices and figured Id better not disturb you.</div><div class="tx">Thanks, I said sarcastically, still trying to figure out how much my mom had heard. I owe you big time for that because you know theres nothing Id rather be doing on my Monday afternoon than rapping with old Liz in there. Now cmon, lets go. No reason to make you any later than you already are.</div><div class="tx">We were just about at the stairwell when Liz appeared at the door of her office. Oh, Mrs. King? she said, patting her hair down like my mom was some kind of VIP guest or something. Hi there, hi there, its great to see you, Liz continued when my mom stopped and turned around. She sounded all formal, like a politician or someone on TV. Shed never been that way with me, not even at our first session. Im so sorry we ran over like that, but we were having such a productive session that I hated to cut it short. I hope it wont cause any problems for you.</div><div class="tx">My mom looked from me to Liz, then decided it was all right for her to smile. No, not at all, not at all, and Im very happy to hear that, she said. It certainly sounded productive in there. Not, of course, that I could  make out any words. I just meant, you know, from all the talk going on.</div><div class="tx">My mom was nervous, and I felt uncomfortable watching her. I wished Liz would just let us take off, but I already knew that wasnt Lizs style. Mrs. King, she said, Im really glad we ran into each other because I was going to call you tomorrow to tell you that I think we can scale back the sessions to just once a week from now on. Your son seems to be . . . she paused to weigh her words . . . out of the danger zone.</div><div class="tx">Well, Im very happy to hear that, my mom said again. Thats really wonderful.</div><div class="tx">And I know, for my cheap-ass mom, it was. Were talking about a woman whose whole day gets made when the rotisserie chickens go on sale for $4.99 at Key Food. My mom hated spending her hard-earned money on <i>anything</i>, and now Liz was telling her the cost of her screwed-up sons therapy sessions was about to be cut in half. Oh, happy day! That was my moms version of winning the lottery.</div><div class="tx">So Ill see you next Monday then? Liz said to me.</div><div class="tx">Sure, whatever. I shrugged. All right, Ma, lets go, aight? Im sure youve gotta a real long to-do list right now and I dont wanna be the one stopping you. I took a step, then another, down the stairs.</div><div class="tx">Well, thank you so much, Ms. Jenner, my mom said, and as she followed me down, I caught the heavy-duty look she and Liz exchanged. Man, adults were always doing that kind of shit, like we didnt notice or something, and I was getting sick of it.</div><div class="tx">When we walked outside, clouds had swept over the sky, obscuring what little light had been peeking down earlier. It was cold and dark, like it was the middle of the night and not just a few hours after school had let out.</div><div class="tx">My mom didnt say anything on the drive homeno big surprise therebut then I wasnt complaining. Id take silence over the previous afternoons blowup anytime. But then, right after shed pulled into the little parking lot behind our building, she turned off the ignition and looked over at me. Honey? she said, quiet and still nervous. Theres something I wanted to talk to you about.</div><div class="tx">My mom had had more shit she wanted to talk about in the last twenty-four hours than in the last two years, it felt like. But she was being real nice still, probably gloating over all the Liz-money shed be saving, so I figured I might as well ride it out for a while. I kept my mouth shut.</div><div class="tx">Im . . . Im proud of you, my mom said after what felt like a two-hour pause. I wouldnt have believed  it myself, but youve really been giving your all to that social worker, havent you? And I justwell, I just really appreciate that. Its helping us all out a lot.</div><div class="tx">I didnt want to know what us she was referring to, so I said, all sharp and sarcastic, Pick up a lot of tasty morsels when you press your ear to the door, dont you, Ma?</div><div class="tx">I saw her flinch and wished I couldve taken back my words. I knew how hard it was for my mom to have conversations like thisalmost as hard as it was for me.</div><div class="tx">No, of course not! my mom said. Ms. Jenner sends progress reports on you to the school, and I get copied inyou know that was the deal from the beginning. And, well, I just have to say, theyre getting more and more positive and ... hopeful. Now if you could only transfer that progress to the classroom, wed all be in good shape, wouldnt we?</div><div class="tx">I gotta say, I was impressed Liz was holding up her end of the deal. If she kept that shit up, Id have my academic probation lifted in no time flat, and life might even return to normal one day.</div><div class="tx">Sweetie, Mom said, and she actually reached across the car to put her hand on my wrist. I shook it off, remembering how shed gone off on me yesterday.</div><div class="tx">Mom flinched a little again and pulled her hand back toward her chest. All I was going to say is that weveIve decided its all right for you to go to that girls party on Saturday. As long as her mother knows youre coming, I wont stand in your way. To tell the truth, Im pleased, sweetie, I really am, that you seem to be making some friends out here.</div><div class="tx">I was too busy processing the first part of what my mom had said to react all the way. So I could go to the party without trying any complicated shit on the fire escape? I couldnt believe it. I thought of Nias face, her gentle smile, and my stomach tossed around like it did when Id had too many cheese fries.</div><div class="tx">Thanks, Mom, I said, and I smiled at her for the first time since I could remember. She smiled back, which was almost as weird.</div></body></html>';

In a way, much as I hated my forty-five-minute sessions with Liz, they at least gave my Monday and Friday afternoons a nice structure. Like I sorta enjoyed having a certain place to be at a certain time: Math lets out, I get my books, I walk to Lizs, I go home. Done and done. I understood better how all those white kids who went to all their clarinet l essons and Cub Scout crap still managed to get better grades than the rest of us poor assholes who dont have all those extra activities. Its because structure just  makes life easier somehow. Maybe that was my moms secret?</div><div class="tx">I was just slamming my locker shut when I caught sight of Nia walking down the hall from the direction of the gym. I still wasnt sure where I stood with her, but when she saw me, her face broke into a smile and she actually waved at me. My chest clenched up a little as I waved back. Had Nia decided to forgive me, finally, for that whole stupid Maurice showdown?</div><div class="tx">I felt even more sure of it as she walked right toward me as if there were no other kids in the hall and just said, Hey, Butterball, hows it going?</div><div class="tx">Now, I know this might sound pretty tweaked coming from me, since its my official nickname and alland if Im being perfectly straight, its probably the nicest one Ive ever hadbut for some reason I didnt love when Nia called me Butterball. I cant explain why exactly; the word just didnt sound right coming from her lips somehow. I wondered for a second if she even knew what my real name was. By now, even the teachers called me Butterball.</div><div class="tx">But all I said was Im cool. Hows it going with you? It was really crazy, how nice she was being, but maybe thats just how Nia was: too nice to stay mad at anyone for long.</div><div class="tx">Okay, I guess, Nia said. So whatcha doing now?</div><div class="tx">UhIm, um, heading over to the OfficeMax on Franklin, I said, thinking fast. Im outta notebooks and shit, and I gotta get some special paper for this stupid life sciences report Im supposed to do.</div><div class="tx">I gotta say, I was pretty damn impressed with myself for coming up with such a smooth lie, and without hardly a pause. It was smart for two totally different reasons: one, because Nia was a crack student, almost as much of a nerd as Maurice had been, especially in science. Reason number two was that I happened to knowand not because Im some sort of crazy-ass stalker, but because the black population of Garden City isnt exactly extensive, and we all live at the same half-a-dozen addressesthat Nia lived in that tall brown-brick building just past the shopping center on Franklin where the biggest office-supply store in Garden City happened to be located. It was the exact opposite direction from my apartment, but I didnt have anywhere particular to be right then.</div><div class="tx">Nia, innocent girl that she was, clapped her hands together. Hey, thats lucky! she said. Thats right near where I live, and I gotta go right home to look after my baby brother. Wanna walk over there together?</div><div class="tx">Yeah, thatd work, I said, my voice all casual and  cool so Nia wouldnt be able to tell how OD excited I was.</div><div class="tx">One thing Ill say about being fat: It does have a couple of advantages. Most girls ignore you or laugh in your face, but the nice ones, the girls like Nia, theyre real friendly to you, even if its probably just because they dont see you as a threat like other guys. Theyll talk to you about shit theyd never say in front of guys they want to get with. Sure, Id still rather look like Darrell, but it wasnt the worst thing in the world, walking down Franklin Avenue with a girl like Nia at my side, thats all Im saying.</div><div class="tx">We exited on the west side of the school, the side that connects to the elementary school that most of my current classmates had gone to since kindergarten. As we walked down the street, neither of us said much, but it wasnt an uncomfortable silence like when I was with my mom, or an angry silence like with Evelyn. We were both just kinda walking along, thinking our thoughts, smiling over at the little kids who were playing on the banged-up graffitied playground.</div><div class="tx">I realized, as we made our way down the street, that Id never really been alone with Nia before. And even if it was the middle of the afternoon and on the main drag  of Garden City, our walking together like that felt real private in a way, almost intimate.</div><div class="tx">After a couple of blocks, Nia broke the silence. Hey, Butterball, can I ask you something?</div><div class="tx">Sure, I said. I was just as happy to talk as not to talk. With Nia at my side, I was just plain happy, end of story.</div><div class="tx">You know the party Im having tomorrow night?</div><div class="tx">I nodded: Every black kid in Garden City knew about Nias party, but this was the first time shed brought it up directly with me.</div><div class="tx">Its actually at my Aunt Coras house, she said.</div><div class="tx">Shes throwing it for my fourteenth birthday since my moms place is so small and full up with little kids all the time.</div><div class="tx">I nodded again, though I hadnt actually known about the aunt. Andres had made the scene sound a little less family-oriented than that.</div><div class="tx">As if reading my thoughts, Nia went on, Coras real youngshe just turned twenty-two a few weeks ago. Shes like fifteen years younger than my mom, so the two of them were never close as kids, you know? But Coras always been real sweet to me, taken me under her wing and stuff.</div><div class="tx">Nia frowned a little, then said, Shes also a little wild, though, and my mom dont like that one bit. Im not saying she been in trouble with the law or gotten pregnant or nothing like that. But my mom still dont trust her. Thinks Coras a troublemaker, and says the baby of the family always turns out like that if you dont watch it. Like my youngest brother Jameshes the one Im gonna watch right nowhe can barely walk and already hes raising hell wherever he can find it.</div><div class="tx">Id love to meet him sometime, I said, then immediately felt like an idiot. Man, Niad be taking out a restraining order against me if I didnt check myself.</div><div class="tx">But she only flashed another smile. Yeah, hes a real cutie, little James. I think hed like you a lot.</div><div class="tx">I love babies, I said, though I have no idea why, since Id spent barely any time with them since my Philly cousins were little. But my mom worked in the neonatal intensive care ward sometimes, and back when she and I used to talk, she was always going on about all the poor little things in there.</div><div class="tx">Anyway, Nia said, Coras just trying to be nice by throwing a party for her favorite niece, but my moms all suspicious and shit. She dont like Coras new boyfriend who she just moved in with, but thats just because hes  got lots of money and a crib my mom could only dream of.</div><div class="tx">That sounds pretty wacked, I said. For the first time, I started to wonder why exactly Nia was telling me all this.</div><div class="tx">So I just dont want anything to get out of hand, right? Nia said, and suddenly it was all clear to me. Nia was telling me <i>not</i> to show up at her aunts party. Id gotten permission from my mom and everything, and now the nicest girl in school was pretty much locking the door in my face.</div><div class="tx">I cant tell you how shitty I felt right then, knowing that was the only reason Nia had walked all those blocks with me. No wonder shed been quiet earlier. It was because shed been building up the courage to let me off easy. Man. I stood there, dead still at the intersection of Franklin and Stewart, feeling like the worlds biggest asshole. And angry as shit, too.</div><div class="tx">Butterball? Nia said, breaking the spell. You okay? The lights changed, cmon.</div><div class="tx">Dont you worry about me, I snapped as I followed her out into the street, but Nia didnt seem to notice the bottled-up rage in my voice. I didnt know why I was still walking with herprobably only because I wasnt all that eager to head back home to find Evelyn rifling through  my personal possessions under the pretense of tidying. Tidying my ass. The only thing harder than keeping my cool with the backstabbing Nia was having a civil conversation with Evelyn.</div><div class="tx">So yeah, Nia was still talking obliviously on, I had a little favor to ask you. It sounds kinda weird, but, well, Id just be real grateful if I mean, if youre comingand you <i>are</i> coming, I hope?could you, like, help me keep an eye on shit? Make sure nothing gets too out of hand, know what I mean?</div><div class="tx">I came to a complete stop again, before wed finished crossing the street. I was trying to process what exactly Nia was asking of me. She <i>hoped</i> I was coming to the party tomorrow night? Had she really just said that? And then, just as she started to look at me funny, I came to my senses and kept walking toward the curb.</div><div class="tx">Sorry, I said quickly. Im still just getting used to these shoes, and as I spoke, I realized that for the first time all week my feet werent hurting me one bit. As for the favor, yeah, sure, Id be happy to help you out tomorrow night. No problem at all.</div><div class="tx">Oh, good, Nia said, smiling over at me. I knew I could count on you, Butterball. Because if any bad shit goes down, my momll have both me and Aunt Cora on  lockdown, Im serious. Im <i>so</i> glad youll be there. I always knew I could count on you.</div><div class="tx">We walked on for a few more minutes, and I gotta say, I was feeling like the king of the world himself under that warm spring sun. And then suddenly Nia came to a stop and said, Well, here we are.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_016_r1.jpg" alt="016" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">I looked around at the big mall parking lot in front of us, totally confused. Here we are what?</div><div class="tx">OfficeMax, Nia said, gesturing at the gigantic store like two feet away from us. Didnt you say you had to get stuff for your science project?</div><div class="tx">I saved myself just in time, right as a suspicious little frown crossed Nias face. Oh, damn. Guess I was just trying to block that Mrs. Stimpson bitch outta my brain, know what Im saying?</div><div class="tx">I laughed real loud, but Nia was still giving me a kinda funny look. All right then, check you later, I  said, andbecause I was kinda embarrassedI walked right through the double doors of OfficeMax without even turning around to wave goodbye.</div><div class="tx">I didnt have a penny in my pocket, but then I also didnt have no science project. Besides, if theres one thing my dad had taught me, it was that you didnt need money to get what you wanted out of life.</div><div class="tx">And what I wanted was ... well, I wasnt too sure exactly. But Nias party was just over twenty-four hours away, and I couldnt remember when Id ever looked forward to anything this much. The weekend ahead was going to kick some serious ass.</div></body></html>';

I really didnt feel like hashing it out with the old lady right then, not after all Id gone through these past couple of days. But the alternativegoing home to my momwas even less appealing.</div><div class="tx">Have a seat, Liz said, her voice all concerned and sweet in a way that put me on guard. For a second I wondered if my mom had called her, but nah, that really wasnt Moms style. Can I get you anything?</div><div class="tx">Nah, Im fine, I said, wishing shed just leave me alone. Wishing everyone would just leave me alone.</div><div class="tx">I picked up some bottles of your favorite beverage over the weekend, Liz said, sounding a little bashful. Just in case you got thirsty. I guess I missed you a little on Friday.</div><div class="tx">Without raising my eyes, I watched her walk over to the fake wood-paneled mini-fridge she kept over in the corner of the room. She popped open the door and took out a one-liter bottle of PQ. I knew raspberry was your favorite, she said, coming over to me with the bottle.</div><div class="tx">I already got one in my bag, I mumbled, but when she handed me the bottle I didnt refuse it. It felt nice and sweaty in my hands, a whole lot cooler than the drinks that came straight out of the 7-Eleven fridge. I <i>was</i> pretty thirstyId had a crazy headache all daybut for a while I just held the bottle between my hands like I hardly knew it was there. Still, I had to admit Lizs little gesture had touched me. I couldnt remember the last time one of my parents had done something spontaneously nice like that.</div><div class="tx">Can you tell me what happened? Liz said as soon as shed settled into her chair. For a second I regretted taking that drink from her. Nothing in life for free, or whatever my dad was always saying.</div><div class="tx">I dont feel like it, I said, the understatement of the year right there.</div><div class="tx">I see your eye is swollen, Liz went on. You look like youve been hit pretty hard.</div><div class="tx">Well, no shit, I said. Its a good thing youve already got a day job because I dont think youd make a very good cop or private detective or whatever.</div><div class="tx">Liz still seemed totally unfazed by my attitude. You also have a lump on your forehead, she observed calmly.</div><div class="tx">Damn, so <i>thats</i> why Ive got such a killer headache, I said, slapping my head right where Id been kicked. It hurt some, but I didnt show it. Id been wonderingthanks for clearing that up for me.</div><div class="tx">And now, finally, Liz changed up her game. She got all stern and crossed her arms in front of her chest as she said, Are you going to tell me what happened yourself, or do I have to ask your mom?</div><div class="tx">Ask her whatever you want, I said with a snarl. That woman dont know shit about what happened, big surprise. Shes even stupider than <i>you</i> are.</div><div class="tx">Well, I guess that means I have to ask you again, Liz said. Itd be a shame if you refused to answer and had to start coming in here twice a week again. Not a shame from my perspective, of courseI truly enjoy your  company. But I know a guy like you, hes got places to be at this hour.</div><div class="tx">I was squinting at her, trying to figure out what she was doing, whether she was making fun of me or not. Liz wasnt that sharp, but she could be plenty conniving when she wanted to be. Yeah, right, I grumbled for lack of anything better to say.</div><div class="tx">No, I mean it, Liz said. Youre a very entertaining conversationalist, did you know that?</div><div class="tx">Yeah, right. I shrugged, wishing I could get out of there already. My head really was killing me, and I was having trouble keeping a step ahead of old Liz that day. Usually it was no problem, but after the shitty-ass day Id just had, I wanted nothing more than to pop a few of my moms backache pills and crawl into bed while it was still light outside.</div><div class="tx">So why dont you entertain me, Liz said, with an account of what exactly happened between last Monday and today to leave you coming in here like this?</div><div class="tx"><i>Like what</i>, I almost asked, but on second thought I didnt have the energy. I shook my head and then, after thinking about it for a while, popped open the PQ shed gotten me. This wasnt going to be fun one way or the other, so I might as well quench my thirst. I took a  gigantic glug and then smacked my lips together. Man, that shit tasted good.</div><div class="tx">Do you mind if I lie back on this? I asked, pointing at the stank couch I was sitting on. The thing looked like itd been on someones stoop for the last twenty years, getting pissed on by every passing rat, bum, and dog before old Liz took pity and dragged it up to this office. But my head was really pounding now, and even the artificial light in Lizs windowless office was killing my eyes.</div><div class="tx">This place felt a little like a jail cell, I realized, as Liz said in her best soothing voice, Of course you can, sweetie. Thats just what its there for. Just make yourself as comfortable as youd like.</div><div class="tx">Sweetie? But I wasnt in the mood to pick no fights just then. I just let it go as I kicked up my legs, stretched out, and closed my eyes tight. I was that damn tired.</div></body></html>';

Especially that last day, after Nia and I had walked to OfficeMax together and shed talked to me like a real friend, like someone she actually trusted. Well, so much for that bullshit.</div><div class="tx">Id spent a long time getting ready for the party: showered, patted my hair down, even clipped my fingernails and shit. When your ass is as big as mine is, you have limited options in the wardrobe department, but I did have one old-school pair of baggy jeans that my mom always said looked slimming. And Id been saving them  all week, along with my South Pole T-shirt that looked as good on me as anything else. I took a damp washcloth to my Foamposites so theyd look brand-new, which I guess they were. When I checked myself out in the mirror, I have to say, I looked kinda good.</div><div class="tx">My mom insisted on driving me over there, but I told her just to drop me by school instead. On a Saturday? she asked a little skeptically. My mom was one of those old-fashioned types who had trouble believing that bad shit went down at school. She was from the time before metal detectors and actually thought school was for learning.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, I answered quickly. The partys just two blocks away from Watkins, so a bunch of my friends and I are meeting on the playground so we can walk over together.</div><div class="tx">I could tell my mom liked that the party was so close to school, as if the scholarly vibes from Watkins might waft over to us while we were dancing or whatever. All right then, she said. If thats what you want.</div><div class="tx">When my mom pulled the car up to the street side of the playground, a confused expression crossed her face. Theres nobody there, she said.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, Im just a little early, I said. Dont worry  about iteveryonell show up soon enough. So go on already, I dont want to make you late for work.</div><div class="tx">My mom was always looking for permission to go ahead and do what she wanted to do anyway, so she nodded and clicked the doors unlocked. All right, honey, she said. Have fun. Just be sure to be home by ten like we agreed on, all right? Evelyn doesnt get off till eleven, but shes coming right by our apartment to make sure you got back okay.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, sure. More like to patrol my every move and rat me out at her first opportunity. But I kept my thoughts to myself. I was this close to freedom, and I wasnt about to blow it.</div><div class="tx">As soon as my mom drove off, I started walking over to the other side of the school, for a couple of blocks retracing the route Nia and I had taken the day before. I hadnt lied to my mom about Nias aunt living real close to school in that nondescript neighborhood with a bunch of one-story houses pushed all close together. But it wasnt true that I was going over there with Andres and the boys. They were all pounding forties over at Darrells place, and even if theyd invited me I doubt I wouldve gone. I wanted to be by myself for a while.</div><div class="tx">To keep from showing up at the party too early, I  walked zigzag for a few minutes, then doubled back to the 7-Eleven on Franklin for some brain food. I picked up a PQ and a king-size Snickers bar and ate them in the parking lot out front before heading back into the neighborhood behind Watkins. I kept on zigzagging back and forth down the streets, always keeping a few blocks away from Coras street just in case someone spotted me.</div><div class="tx">The houses around here werent much to look atnothing like Maurices fancy-ass part of townbut still, a house was a house, and any house beat a crammed-full apartment like the one my mom and I shared. No wonder Nias mom was jealous of her little sister. I would be, too.</div><div class="tx">Maurice had lived in a house for as long as he could remember, he told me once. Theyd moved from his grandparents place when he was two, pretty soon after his dad had gotten the job at IBM. His neighborhood was one over from Nias aunts place, and a whole lot nicer, probably the second-nicest part of Garden City. It was mostly white, too, which could explain why Maurice acted the way he did: Hed always been an outsider. Another problem was that Maurices parents treated him like the worlds biggest genius, so he thought he could say whatever he wanted and get away with it, or more  than thatbe praised for it. No one had ever called him on his bullshit before, at least not until he met me.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, Maurice lived in an all-white neighborhood and thought that just because his neighbors didnt double-lock their car doors when they saw him coming, it meant that the whole world had changed. Well, he had no idea what he was talking about, and I was the only one whod ever bothered teaching him that.</div><div class="tx">It was dark out now, and I finally decided itd be safe to head over to the party, so I turned that direction and started walking with more purpose. I was just about half a block away when I heard Andress voice behind me: Hey, Butterball, man, wait up!</div><div class="tx">I turned to see him, Bobbie, and Darrell weaving up the street toward me. Part of me was relieved that I hadnt gotten to the party too early, and that I wouldnt have to show up alone like the friendless fatass I was. But another part of me felt . . . I cant describe it exactly. Something other than relieved.</div><div class="tx">Hey, guys, whats up whats up, I said, fist-bumping all three guys when they caught up to me. Even before any of them had spoken muchand even if I hadnt overheard them discussing their plans at lunch the day beforeI wouldve known theyd been drinking. It was  something about how they were laughing too loudly, and for too long, at all sorts of shit that wasnt even a little funny. And something about how Andres kept clapping me on the back, like bumping into me outside of Nias aunts house was just about the greatest thing that had ever happened to him.</div><div class="tx">He even complimented meMan, youre sure looking sharp, aint you?and plucked my South Pole shirt between his fingers. Thats a real fly shirt there. Goes great with your shoes.</div><div class="tx">Thanks, I said, feeling pretty good as we made our way into the little house.</div><div class="tx">Ive gotta say, given what Nia had told me the day before, the scene wasnt entirely what Id expected. Shed made it sound like Cora was all edgy and shit, but everyone there was all talking real quiet. And it felt more like a school assembly than a bumping Saturday-night party. There was a big ice-bucket filled with Poland Spring water bottles and Sprites, and the music playing was soft easy-listening shit, like maybe Dionne Warwick or Patti LaBelle. Music my mom listened to back when she had time to listen to music.</div><div class="tx">After a few minutes, Nia rushed up to say hi. Whats up, guys! she exclaimed, greeting us all together. Looking  at her, youd never have guessed that the two of us had walked a mile down Franklin Avenue together just the day before. But I didnt mind. I kinda liked having a little secret with her.</div><div class="tx">Here, come out back, Nia said, tuggingI couldnt help noticeDarrell by the arm. My aunt is so cool. She set up a limbo pole for us!</div><div class="tx">The boys and I all looked at one another. A limbo pole? What, was Nia turning seven and not fourteen? But still, I gotta say, I thought her innocence was ... cool. It was one of the qualities that made her so sweet and open with everyone.</div><div class="tx">Oh, <i>man</i>, Andres grumbled under his breath behind me. This is one whacked-out party. Bobbie and Darrell grunted their agreement as we followed Nia out back. The yard was barely bigger than my moms kitchen, but you could tell Cora and her boyfriend took good care of it. There was fresh grass and a couple of big potted plants. From inside the music was playing loud, but not loud enough to piss off the neighbors. It was just the right volume.</div><div class="tx">Hey, you want a beer or something? Darrell asked me under his breath. I got a whole bunch of them in my bag here.</div><div class="tx">I shot a glance over at Nia and shook my head. Even if she hadnt been standing right there, my answer wouldve been the same: Nah, Im cool, I said. Id had sips of my dads beers all the time. Id even been drunk before. But in front of Nia, I didnt want to make an ass of myself for no reason.</div><div class="tx">Youre missing out, Darrell said, reaching into his bag and pulling out three cans of Pabst, which he passed to the other guys. Nia saw him, but didnt seem to care. Darrell was just the kind of guy who could get away with anything in which members of the opposite sex were concerned.</div><div class="tx">Ill be back in a while, Nia said after standing out there with us a little longer. You guys behave now, you promise?</div><div class="tx">The boys just laughed, but I nodded and repeated promise in a real serious voice.</div><div class="tx">The song is tight, dont you think? Bobbie said as Nia made her way back inside.</div><div class="tx">He was talking to me, so I said, Yeah. Real tight. I dont think Id ever heard the song before, but I definitely liked it.</div><div class="tx">Oh, hey, you see who that is standing over there? Andres asked suddenly. He, too, was looking right at me.  Guy with the shit-eating grin on his faceyou know who that is?</div><div class="tx">I both knew and didnt want to know, so I just shrugged as I flicked my eyes over to the guy leaning against the only tree in the backyard.</div><div class="tx">Terrence Johnson in the flesh, Darrell said unnecessarily. What a piece of shit that guy is, damn.</div><div class="tx">I didnt know what to say, so I just kept on standing there, tapping my foot like I was getting real into the song Id never heard before. But Andres wasnt going to let me off that easy. He took a big long chug of his beer and made an aah! sound, like hed just finished a race. And then he clapped me right on the back. Im still thinking that mofo needs to be taught a real good lesson right about now, wouldnt you say, Butterball? And were luckywe mighty, mighty luckythat weve got just the guy to do it. Dont you think?</div><div class="tx">The guy Terrence was laughing real loud and, yeah, he looked like a douchebag, but Id be lying if I said I felt anything for him in that moment. He was just another tall good-looking guy, and I didnt have no beef with him. I remembered the promise Id made to Nia the day before and finally met Andress gaze. It took everything I had in me to say, Nah, I dont really see the point of it.</div><div class="tx">Andres hooted at this. He was still staring at me so hard, like in one of those espionage movies in which the CIA interrogators are trying to break the double agent. It was like torture. After too long a pause, Andres echoed, The point? The <i>point</i>, boy? Whats that even mean?</div><div class="tx">Now all three of themAndres and Bobbie and Darrellwere all looking right at me. Their eyes were glassy from all the drinks theyd had, and I was starting to feel a little confused. IIm not sure, I said finally. What I meant was ... well, I guess I dont really know.</div><div class="tx">Well, then how bout I spell it out for you, huh? Darrell said, coming so close I could smell his boozy breath on my face. Andres still had his hand on my back, and I had a claustrophobic sensation, like the walls were closing in on me. The point, Darrell went on, is that he stole Tammy from our boy Bobbie, and if you dont watch out, hes gonna steal Nia, too.</div><div class="tx">I shot my eyes around the backyard to make sure Nia wasnt within hearing range. What do you mean? I whisper-hissed. Theres nothing between me and Nia and you know it!</div><div class="tx">Dont you worry, B-ball, man, Andres said, his hand now making smooth stroking motions down my back. We know your game, and were all totally cool with it.  Nias a good pick. You got some fly taste, and not just in shoes. So lets get this party started, what do you say? Show Nia and the rest of us whos boss, what do you say?</div><div class="tx">I tried to squirm away, but Andress grip on my back was firm. It was clear none of them were messing around. Well, I said finally, its too bad, but I didnt bring my batteries tonight. I forgot.</div><div class="tx">At this, all three boys grinned at me. Youre in luck, Andres said, grinning widest of all, because <i>I</i> didnt. Our asses came prepared. And just like that he reached into the pocket of his hoodie, pulled out a sock, and stuck it right in my hand.</div><div class="tx">I got more if you want, Darrell said, pointing at the backpack where he kept the beers.</div><div class="tx">Nah, I said. Thanks, but I think thisll be fine.</div><div class="tx">As my fingers closed around the sock, I felt the cool weight of the batteries through the cotton, much heavier than what Id used with Maurice. Andres mustve loaded two packs of batteries in there, damn. This thing could do some serious damage.</div><div class="tx">Cmon, man, Andres urged, it was so cool when you jumped that little piece of shit on the playground. We hadnt known what a badass you was before.</div><div class="tx">As I gripped the sock in my hand, something surged  inside me, and I remembered what my dad had told me at the movie theater that night, about wanting respect. About <i>needing</i> it. And I looked over at that guy Terrence and I dont know what happened, but somehow, for a split second there, all I saw was Maurices face. Maurice the loser, who would never have been invited to this party in a hundred years and who wouldnt have gone even if he had been.</div><div class="tx">Still, though, I wasnt planning on doing nothing. I hadnt forgotten the promise Id made Nia the day before. I took that shit seriously, wanted her to know she could count on me.</div><div class="tx">Go on, now, Andres was saying, giving my back a shove. This partys boring as shit. We need ol Butterball to liven shit up, right, boys?</div><div class="tx">Out of the corner of my eye I could see Darrell and Bobbie high-fiving each other, and then another real strange sensation swept over me. It was like my brain was no longer there in Aunt Coras backyard, but like I was floating ten feet up in the air, looking down at Garden City and all the stupid shit the kids there thought was so important. And Maurice, who thought he knew everything about me but actually knew jack shit. Whod deserved even worse than hed gotten.</div><div class="tx">By the time I strode over to where Terrence stood laughing with his friends, my brain was completely blank. I wasnt thinking nothing at all, not one thing, as I windmilled my arm back and took a swing right at his face.</div><div class="tx">And then all time seemed to stop. While my arm was still suspended midair, Terrence gave me a look Ill never be able to erase from my memory no matter how hard I try: It was like even with a sock full of batteries in my hand, I didnt scare him even a little bit. I was the same big fat joke Id always been.</div><div class="tx">Then, in the same split second, all slow and casual-like, Terrence ducked, and instead of hitting his face my hand flailed wildly in the air. I lost my balance and went teetering forward into the tree.</div><div class="tx">That was the last thing I remember clearly. Next thing I knew, I was on the ground, people were laughing, and there were sneakers smashing into my face. Oh, man, the pain, I cant even describe the pain I was feeling, but it was only in my body.</div><div class="tx">My brain was still far, far away, floating high above everyones petty little lives, including mine. At some point I heard Nias voice shouting, Stop it! Get off him! then a chorus of other voices saying, But he started it! and then, above the rest, a strong male voiceand even in my  messed-up state I knew it had to be Terrencesay, All right, boys, give it a rest. This blubberbutt aint worth soiling your shoes on no more.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_017_r1.jpg" alt="017" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">And then some older dude had me by the collar of my South Pole shirt, and just like that I was out on the street again, alone as Id ever been in my life. Id probably been at the party a grand total of three minutes before shit went south.</div><div class="tx">I was back home by nine oclock, not like anyone ever came back to check on me.</div></body></html>';

I popped my eyes open and realized where I was all of a sudden. Oh, damn. I didnt know what had come over me, or how long Id been like that. I felt suddenly embarrassed in that roomdark now, since Liz had dimmed the lights at some point over the last hour. Had I actually fallen asleep? On today of all days, Id strolled into Lizs office and passed out like an old drunk? Man, sometimes I really did have trouble understanding why I acted like I did.</div><div class="tx">I rubbed my eyes, still thinking of how Id floated  over everyone like that, and how I wished I could live my whole life like that, suspended a few feet in the air. Is that what Clark Kent felt like when he walked into the phone booth and came out Supermanthat his body no longer belonged to him? Or Spider-Man, who was just a nerdy-ass kid like me before he grew all his extra legs? What happened inside those superheroes as their bodies slipped out from under them and became something totally differentor, like me, did they feel nothing at all?</div><div class="tx">Nah, Im just fooling myself. More than usual, I mean. Those guys, they helped people. I dont know what I thought I was doing in Coras backyard, but it sure wasnt that. And when I woke up yesterday morning and saw my face in the mirrormy eye a shitload more wacked-out-looking than itd been the night before, so puffed-up I could hardly open it at allI knew Id gotten exactly what I deserved.</div><div class="tx">You didnt deserve it, Liz said, her voice coming at me from miles away. Nobody ever deserves to get beat up like that.</div><div class="tx">Had I really said that shit out loud? I pulled my hand away from my face and shrank into the sofa. I guess it was no big surprise that Liz didnt know what she was talking about. I <i>had</i> deserved every kick that had landed on  my ass. But Terrencenah. Terrence was just some guy whod never done me no harm in his life before I walked up to him with that sock. Like I said, I dont know what I was thinking.</div><div class="tx">Maurice, well, that was a different deal. Try as I might, I still couldnt feel all that bad for getting even with Maurice like I did. I thought of the firstthe onlytime Id had him over to our apartment, and for the millionth time I wondered if I could somehow take back that invitation, lock the deadbolt on him, keep him from seeing whatever he thought he saw. And saying all that shit hed said. Liz would never understand, so there was no point in my telling her. It was like she could sense how hard just showing up had been for me, how tired I still was, so after all her hooting and hollering, she seemed to make a conscious decision, just this once, to let me off easy. To just let me sit in place and wake up in my own good time while that terrible memory looped over and over in my head.</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">Id never had Maurice to my place before because it was so much scummier than his fancy suburban crib, but Id stayed up late the night before fixing shit up so itd look as nice as it could look. Id stacked all of  Moms nursing textbooks and notebooks and put them on the bureau in her bedroom. Evelyn had even gotten out our old Dirt Devil and cleaned up the floor a little, and when I left for school that morning Id thought the place didnt look as busted as it usually did. It had looked almost kinda nice.</div><div class="tx">Anyway I did all that, really knocked myself out, and Id even gone over to Key Food to fill the kitchen with the kind of healthy shit Maurices mom always had on hand, orange juice and graham crackers and even those little miniature carrots she kept chilled in the fridge. So yeah, <i>thats</i> what Id been afraid of: that Maurice would see how ghetto we were, how close to coming apart at the seams. It had never occurred to me that hed see something else in this raggedy-ass apartment, much less run off his mouth about it like he did.</div><div class="tx">As soon as wed gone in my bedroom, hed said, Now I understand why youve never brought me here before, but I just want you to know Im cool with it. Im not like all those other kids at school. My parents are educated, and theyve taught me to be accepting of all different types of people.</div><div class="tx">What the hell are you talking about? I asked. Because, like a dumbass, I honestly didnt know.</div><div class="tx">Maurice had looked me right in the face and said, I know your moms gay, Butterball. You couldve just told me because I wouldnt have cared. And because he obviously wasnt still looking at my face at the time, he went on, I think its really cool, actually. I never wouldve guessed, but now it kind of makes sense.</div><div class="tx">I came very close to killing him dead right then, and I mightve if not for my mom and Evelyn just on the other side of the wall. I didnt want them to overhear nothing, which was just one of the reasons I wanted Maurice out of the apartment. Just one of the reasons.</div><div class="tx">What Maurice was saying to mehe was telling lies. Crazy, evil lies. I didnt know what he was talking about. I didnt want to know what he was talking about. I tried to imagine my dads face if hed happened to walk in the room at this exact moment . . . if hed happened to walk in during all sorts of moments that had gone down since wed moved out here. My dad wouldnt take this shit. Not from my mother, and definitely not from stupid-ass Maurice.</div><div class="tx">You know who Miss Stipler is? The wellness counselor? Maurice asked me a few seconds later. He still wasnt keyed into my state of mind, like not even a little bit. Yeah, I knew who Miss Stipler wasa tiny, muscular woman who dressed like she was in the Army and, even  at under five feet tall, looked capable of crushing Mike Tyson in the ring.</div><div class="tx">Shes a lesbian, too, you know, and shes not embarrassed about it at all, Maurice went on cluelessly. She has a girlfriend, or partner I guess is the word she used. You should talk to her sometime if you want. Shes a nice lady, for real. She taught my health class last year and I liked her a lot. She cared about us kids in a way that not too many teachers at Watkins do, you know?</div><div class="tx">By this point I was having trouble breathing. I glared across the room at Maurice, seeing if I could kill him with my eyes like some minor superhero. It didnt work. Stop talking now, Maurice, I grumbled, low and threatening so hed know I meant it. I hated him, hated what he was saying, and hated how he wasnt paying attention to me at all, like hed gone off in his own world and forgotten all about me.</div><div class="tx">I mean, shit. There was a limit to what I could take, with Maurice and everyone else. I was done with him, done listening to that squeaky know-it-all voice and reading his stupid-ass graphic novels that his rich parents bought him whenever he asked. He could go on and become a lawyer and make a million dollars for all I cared, but I wanted no more part in it.</div><div class="tx">I got off my bed and walked the three steps toward where Maurice was sitting at my little desk. Get out of my house, I said, getting all up in his face so hed get the message fast. You could fit about four Maurices inside my tightest pair of jeans, but somehow in that moment, for just a split second, I was the one afraid of him.</div><div class="tx">Maurice had all the power now, but what would he do with it? He was a nobody, yeah, but one wrong word from even the biggest nobody in school would be enoughmore than enoughto undo everything Id built out here. And you just could never predict what was going to come out of that smirking, know-it-all mouth next. I thought of my dad again, of what hed say or do if he found out. Would he blame me? Like getting stuck out here in the middle of nowhere was my choice, or like I wasnt man enough to keep my mom on the straight and narrow. I could just see the look of disgust and disappointment on his face, and I knew it could never, ever happen.</div><div class="tx">Hey, relax, Maurice said. Like I said, I think its really coolits like something youd see on a TV show, you know? And your moms girlfriend is <i>so</i> pretty, too!</div><div class="tx">Shes <i>not</i> her girlfriend, I said, my voice barely above a whisper, but all the fury impossible to miss, so that even  Maurice might finally pick up what I was putting down. And I want you out of this apartment right this second or I swear to God Ill throw you out head first.</div><div class="tx">Maurice looked at me, and for the first time his eyes got all wide and scared. Hey, listen, its no big deal, all right? You dont have to get all pissed at me. I was just saying that if you had any questions or anything, Miss Stipler might</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_018_r1.jpg" alt="018" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">Im not going to say shit to Miss Stipler, I growled, and whats more neither is your ass. So get the hell out of here, and I mean now. I grabbed him by the collar and yanked him to his feet.</div><div class="tx">All right, all right, man, chill, let go of me!</div><div class="tx">When I finally released my grip on his collar, I saw Id been holding on tight, pulling the shirt so close to his neck that it left a little mark when I let go. We were at the door of the apartment now, and thank God my mom and Evelyn were both in the kitchen, talking and laughing together. My mom never sounded that happy when it was just me around.</div><div class="tx">I opened the front door of the apartment and shoved Maurice as hard as I could into the hall, then shut the door fast behind him. Then I walked right back into my room and shut that door, too. Didnt want to put no damper on all the fun and games my mom and Evelyn were having.</div><div class="tx">About two minutes later, I heard a knock and then my moms voice. Boys? she said. Dinners ready.</div><div class="tx">When I shuffled out into the main room, I could tell she was surprised to see me alone, but, being my mom, she held her tongue. Evelyn, as usual, was less discreet. Wheres your friend? she asked.</div><div class="tx">He had to go home, I muttered, thinking, <i>That asshole is</i> not <i>my friend.</i></div><div class="tx">I saw my mom and Evelyn exchange a look. I was getting pretty sick of adults and all their looks, but what could I say about it? Nothing, so I just kept on sitting there on the couch where I ate all my meals. Evelyn and Mom let the subject drop, too, and I thought there might have been some benefits to living in a house where no one ever said shit.</div><div class="tx">I never spoke to Maurice again, or not directly. He  came up to me a few times in the cafeteria, looking droopy and pathetic, but I never turned around, never even nodded at him in the hall ever again. I decided to just let it all slide until that day about two weeks after his visit to my apartment when I felt a little tap on my shoulder in the cafeteria line.</div><div class="tx">I turned around but didnt see anyone until I looked down toward my feet. There, about a foot below me, was Miss Stipler, the dyke health teacher Maurice loved so much. She looked like she was hopping the next plane to Afghanistan in these crazy green pants with pockets bulging out everywhere. Even for Watkins, her outfit was crazy as shit.</div><div class="tx">Hi there, she said, smiling up at me. Hows it going?</div><div class="tx">I gave her a psycho look. Why was this woman talking to me? Shed never had me for a class, and Watkins teachers didnt just go up to kids and randomly talk to them like that.</div><div class="tx">I couldnt help but notice your meal selection, she said, and I glanced down at the plastic orange tray in my hands. Four slices of pepperoni pizza, my usual on a Monday. What about it? And I was just wondering if your mother knows what youre having for lunch today?</div><div class="tx">My insides froze, and it all clicked into place. So hed gone and done it, had he? That little fool. What does my mom have to do with anything? I asked gruffly.</div><div class="tx">I do counseling for students, she went on. Free of charge, too, so if you ever need anything, Im always around. I just wanted you to know that. You can bring your mom, too, if youd like.</div><div class="tx">Youd better leave my mom out of it, I said, backing out of the line as if shed maced me. A dark burst of hatred flared up in my chest and almost knocked me backward. My dads face floated through my brain, and I tried to push it away, but not fast enough. <i>Be a man, be a real man for a change.</i> The words kept running uselessly through my brain. But how? I had no idea.</div><div class="tx">I was practically gasping for breath as I threw down my tray and ran straight out of that cafeteria. I had to be alone; I had to figure out exactly what to do, and fast. Only one thing was clear to me right then: Maurice had really stepped in it this time, and damned if Id let him get away with it.</div></body></html>';

It wasnt yet six oclock, but I felt like Id been on my feet for days. Sometimes napping does that to mereminds me of just how tired I was to begin with. I felt groggy and slow and just wanted to go straight to bed.</div><div class="tx">Liz, at least, had stayed easy on me for the rest of the session. I guess she figured that, with my face all swollen and nasty, I had enough problems without having to go into it with her. Thanks for letting me sit here, I said as I got up to go. For not, um, waking me, I mean.</div><div class="tx">Anytime, Butterball, Liz said, with a broad smile I couldnt begin to understand.</div><div class="tx">After Id come into the living room looking all messed-up on Saturday morning, Mom had made it clear that I was never leaving the apartment again, except for school and Liz. For Mom, it was actually quite a speech, maybe three whole sentences from start to finish: She lets me go to a party despite being grounded, and I reward her trust with a black eye and an egg-shaped lump on my forehead and a flat-out refusal to tell her what had happened? No, sir, she wasnt making <i>that</i> mistake again.</div><div class="tx">So that morning, before dropping me off at school, Mom went door-to-door through the apartment building and asked our neighborspeople shed never once spoken to beforeif they wouldnt mind letting her know if they saw me leaving the house unsupervised at any hour. Those were the exact words she usedtalking about her son like he was some kinda parolee who needed to be under surveillance 24-7. That was how low things had gotten.</div><div class="tx">The one neighbor who I saw took a real pleasure in Moms request was that little kid Maliks grandmother, who spent most of her days on a cheap folding chair on the sidewalk right outside the basement apartment she  shared with him and his mom. Mrs. Rutherford was like one of those stoop-sitting old ladies in Harlem, only in Garden City there was no street life worth watching. Shed had it in for me big time since that night Id roughed Malik up.</div><div class="tx">That Monday after my session with Liz, my mom took off soon after shed dropped me back at home, only this time I knew she wasnt going to work. She was going out with Evelyn. They had private matters to discuss, shed said, and I wondered if one of those private matters involved putting me in a military academy or some shit they made scary TV shows about. At this point, I wouldnt put nothing past my mom.</div><div class="tx">Evelyn had left one of her stews warm on the stovetop for me, along with some tortillas she made herself while waiting for my mom to get back from picking me up. I dont know where a black woman from Newark, New Jersey, learns to make her own tortillas, but I had to admit they were damn good.</div><div class="tx">Even though Id never been more beat, I knew I couldnt sleep if I tried, so I decided, a few minutes after my mom and Evelyn took off, to call my dad. Shit was getting so wacked out here, damn. If my dad had any idea, hed definitely rescue me from the situation. And  yeah, so maybe things hadnt gone so great at Nias party on Saturday, but at least Id gone for it, just like my dad had told me to do. I mightve been outmatched, but I hadnt been afraid. Not at first, anyway.</div><div class="tx">Hey, Dad, whats up? I said when he picked up on like the sixth ring.</div><div class="tx">Oh, hey, B-Ball, man, Dad said. He was outside somewhere. I could hear the city sounds I loved so muchhonking mostly, and distant shoutsbehind him. Damn, I thought it was Shari calling and almost didnt pick up. No offense intended, but Im not much in the mood for your moms bullshit right now.</div><div class="tx">Shes not here right now, I said. I hadnt spoken to my dad since the Sunday after our trip to Atmos NYC, when hed ridden the express train all the way down to Penn Station with me. Crazy that was only eight days ago.</div><div class="tx">So I just wanted to know, Dad, if maybe I could come see you this week sometime? Like maybe tomorrow? The thought of going back to Watkins so soon ... I just couldnt deal with another day like the one Id just had.</div><div class="tx">Tomorrow? my dad repeated. Am I smoking crack, or is tomorrow a Tuesday?</div><div class="tx">It is, I said. But I just really, really want to come  out and see you if thats okay. I wont be any trouble, I swear. Youll hardly know I was there.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, well, sorry, B-ball man, but some of us gotta work for a living, know what Im saying? Only thing youd be doing here tomorrow is staring at the walls of my apartment all day.</div><div class="tx">I wouldnt care, I said, and I was being serious. Staring at the walls in the city was a million times better than staring at them here. It didnt even compare. I promise I wouldnt care at all.</div><div class="tx">Well, you know what, B-Ball, <i>I</i> would, my dad said. Now, its none of my business to inquire into why you done call me up on a Monday night blubbering like a little baby, but we both know Shari would have my balls in a sling if she thought I had any part in your missing school. So you do what you gotta do, boy, but not on my watch. Oh, hey there, Diane, he shouted suddenly, and the background noises got a lot louder as he took the phone away from his ear.</div><div class="tx">A few seconds later my dad hung up the phone without waiting for me to reply, and that was just fine with me because my voice wasnt working right anyway. Besides, I had shit to do before Mom and Evelyn got back. Id hidden the jeans Id worn on Saturday night in the darkest  corner under my bed, but I knew Evelyn would fish them out if I left them there too long.</div><div class="tx">I went into my bedroom and hunched down to pull them out. They still stank of urine, as if Id just pissed myself again. As if wetting my pants in front of the whole eighth grade wasnt enough for one lifetime.</div><div class="tx">I had to wash that shit, destroy the evidence, before Mom and Evelyn got back. I had enough quarters to do a years worth of laundry in the basement, but for the life of me I couldnt find that damn bottle of Gain my mom usually kept right on top of the fridge. Still, I couldnt risk anyone finding the jeansI had to take care of them tonight. I considered knocking on a neighbors door to ask if I could borrow some detergent, but that seemed pretty sketchy. Besides, it wasnt like I was on speaking terms with anyone in the buildingespecially now, when theyd all had been charged with patrolling my every move.</div><div class="tx">After a while, I took out the old Batman lunchbox where I was saving cash for a laptop I could edit my movies on and counted out ten dollars. I had no idea how much new detergent cost, but I didnt want to come up short. I could also use another PQ. Even after the liter Liz had gotten me and the one from my backpack Id  drunk on the way home, my throat still felt all scraped dry. Garden City tap water tasted like shit, and of course there was nothing else to drink in the apartment. And yeah, it felt good to sneak out without my moms permission. If she cared so bad about where I was, then she couldve stayed home to watch me herself.</div><div class="tx">I made it outside without running into anyone in the hall or stairwell, and out on the street Maliks grandmothers chair was empty, too. She was more of a daytime stoop-sitter, Mrs. Rutherford. When it got dark out, shed usually go inside to sleep or watch TV or whatever it is mean as shit old people did at night.</div><div class="tx">I walked briskly past my usual bodega, which sold maybe thirty different kinds of beer but not a single bottle of detergent, and headed for the big 7-Eleven behind Watkins. That was probably the closest place that would have detergent, and maybe a little exercise would do me some good, yeah right.</div><div class="tx">Once I got to the 7-Eleven, I went straight to the refrigerated shelves at the back for my PQ, then wandered around in search of the cleaning products. Id just turned down the aisle and spotted the big plastic tub of Tide when I ran smack into her.</div><div class="tx">Nia. I hadnt seen her at school earlier, but to tell the  truth I hadnt exactly been looking for her. Id pretty much stayed on the down low all day: gotten my lunch from the vending machine outside the teachers lounge and eaten the three packs of cheese-cracker sandwiches inside the handicapped stall of the seventh-grade bathroom. Just like old times.</div><div class="tx">I didnt know what Nia was doing in that 7-Eleven on a school nightshe lived way on the other side of townuntil I saw what she was buying: a big container of bleach and some of that Comet stuff my mom sometimes used to scrub out the bathtub. And then I realized, without even thinking about it, that Id come within three blocks of her Aunt Coras house. Nia must still be picking up the mess from Saturday night. I didnt know much of what had gone down after Coras boyfriend had kicked me to the curb, but Im pretty sure it was no limbo-dancing.</div><div class="tx">My already-dry throat felt like it was filled with sand as I said, Oh, hey there, Nia, um, hows it going?</div><div class="tx">And then she looked right at me, and man, I cant even begin to describe the flashing hatred I saw in her eyes. I couldnt remember the last time <i>Id</i> felt like that about someonewell, except for Maurice, but everything about Maurice felt far away now, like a scene in a movie Id only half-watched while doing homework.</div><div class="tx">How do you think its going? she snapped after a second.</div><div class="tx">Im sorry, Nia, I mumbled, eyes on my feet. I didnt know what else to say.</div><div class="tx">Sorry for what? she asked. For ruining my whole party just for the hell of it? For getting me in trouble with my mom <i>and</i> my aunt for no reason at all?</div><div class="tx">It wasnt for no reason, I said. You dont understand, I</div><div class="tx">I dont <i>understand</i>? she repeated incredulously. Right, kind of like I didnt understand what made you bash poor Maurices face in? Nia was practically screaming, and when I looked up I saw her friend Imani at the end of the aisle, watching us through the display of week-old rotating hotdogs. I dont know why that bothered me, knowing Nia was putting on a show for Imani, too.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, Butterball, Nia said, I guess thats true. I dont understand you for shit. I dont understand why a guy who was so nice and always had the coolest ideas when he sat across from me in art class last year has turned into this crazy-ass psychopath who walks around jumping complete strangers just because he feels like it. And do you know what? I dont want to understand no more. Im done trying with you.</div><div class="tx">B-but, I sputtered out, that guy Terrence, you have no idea what hes like.</div><div class="tx">And suddenly Nia was right up in my face, poking her finger into my chest. Id never noticed how tall she was before. She almost came up to eye-level with me. Oh, <i>really</i>? she was all-out shouting. <i>I</i> dont know Terrence? Thats funny because hes lived in my building since we was two years old! Five floors up from me, my whole damn life. His mom and mine are like sisters, and youre telling <i>me</i> I dont know Terrence? Nuh-uhshe was shaking her head, still poking me hardyoure the one who dont know Terrence! He said the first time hed ever seen you was when you tried to pound him with that sock of batteries! Im sorry his friends kicked you, but shit, you deserved a lot worse if you ask me. I picked up that sock lateryou could have killed him, Butterball! And right after I asked you to help me out, too! What were you even <i>thinking</i>?</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_019_r1.jpg" alt="019" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">But then she made a huffing sound and backed away from me suddenly. Never mind. Dont answer that. Like I said, Im done trying to understand that shit. I dont care. Im done, done, <i>done</i>.</div><div class="tx">Im sorry, Nia, I said, my voice barely above a whisper.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, well, Im sorry, too, she said. Sorry for believing you were something other than what you acted like. Ill never make <i>that</i> mistake again.</div><div class="tx">And before I could say another word, Nia spun around and marched up to the register, where the Pakistani man behind the counter was watching the takedown like it was the most entertaining shit hed ever seen. Nia paid for her stuff and stormed back out into the parking lot with Imani. Neither of them glanced back at me even once.</div><div class="tx">My mind was racing, and I could hardly breathe. Nothing made any sense at all. Terrence lived in Nias building?  Shed known him since they were two? That wasnt what Andres had made it sound like, but I realized it didnt much matter one way or the other. Nothing mattered for shit. Like Nia had said, I was done, done, done.</div><div class="tx">I counted down from ninety after Nia and Imani left before approaching the register. The last thing I wanted to do was look that checkout guy in the face, but I needed to buy the damn detergent. I left the PQ behind, though. For some reason, I just wasnt all that thirsty anymore.</div></body></html>';

Well, well, well, he said, coming right up to me in the hall by my locker. If it isnt old Blubberbutt.</div><div class="tx">The boys cracked up at this; I knew none of them wouldve forgotten the name Terrence had used before scooping my pee-soaked ass off the ground on Saturday.</div><div class="tx">Hey, guys, I mumbled. Whats going on? I knew this first meeting wasnt going to be all that fun, but I guess it was better just to get it over with. Like I had any choice in the matter.</div><div class="tx">Darrell and Bobbie were staring hard at me, waiting,  as always, for a prompt from their leader. I slammed my locker shut and headed down the hall as fast as I could. I knew the boys were right behind me, but I tried to pretend like I didnt care. And in some way, I kinda didnt.</div><div class="tx">So what happened to you Saturday night? Andres asked as I came close to the exit by the gym. He slipped between me and the door, Darrell and Bobbie right at his flanks like his own personal bodyguard detail.</div><div class="tx">What do you mean, what happened? I asked, trying to play it off all innocent-like. I knew Id made a fool of myself at that party, but I felt like Id already been punished enough for it. More than enough.</div><div class="tx">You sure dont put up much of a fight, do you? Andres asked, and the boys cracked up again. I mean, unless crying like a girl and pissing all over yourself counts. Oh, man, Id never seen anything so crazy!</div><div class="tx">Yeah, man, your little show sure turned that party around fast, Darrell said.</div><div class="tx">The boys kept on laughing, and I felt sick at the reminder of what exactly had gone down after Id missed Terrences face and stumbled forward into the tree. It took about half a second for Terrences friend to land that first punch to my face, and even if he was only using  his fist, I cant imagine a sock full of batteries hurting half that much.</div><div class="tx">Now Bobbie spoke for the first time. You was supposed to show that dude a lesson, he said, and instead you ended up being another notch in his belt. You even made him look <i>good</i> for stopping shit when he did, when anyone else wouldve wiped the goddamned ground with your blood, know what Im saying? And thats what pissed me off the most, Ill be honest. Thats what really makes me want to get even with <i>you</i> now.</div><div class="tx">Something in his voice made me look up at him. Bobbie never said much, but he always meant every word, so when he wound his arm back and lunged forward at me, I let out a squeal. Bobbie dropped his arm about an inch from my face, and everyone busted up laughing again, including some kids Id never seen before whod gathered to watch.</div><div class="tx">Damn, Andres said, you have gots to chill, man. We was just messing with you, B-ball! My man Bobbie is a lover, not a fighter, know what Im saying?</div><div class="tx">The three of them traded high-fives and fist bumps while I just stood there crumpled against the exit door. In a way I wish Bobbie <i>had</i> hit me straight on. A blow to the head couldnt make me feel any worse.</div><div class="tx">Cmon, boys, lets get outta here, Andres said. Darrell and Bobbie both stepped back from where theyd been pressing into me, and just like that the three of them started walking back toward the other exit door that led to the playground.</div><div class="tx">Man, we shouldve known that fatass wasnt up to no real opponent, Andres mumbled loudly as they made their way out. Only kids he can fight weigh like 120 on a good day.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, Darrell said, and Blubberbutt couldve just sat his big ass on that kid, and hed be deader than dead. He didnt need no batteries for that one.</div><div class="tx">The boys laughed again, and I just stood there, back against the wall, until theyd rounded the corner and were out of sight. I knew they were talking about Maurice, who was as little and scrawny as I was big and fat.</div><div class="tx">But one thing about Maurice, I realized as I stood there waiting for the hall noises to fade out and all the kids to stop their staring, he was no coward. When Id gone up to him in the playground that day, hed barely blinked. Hed never cried, never shouted out, never done nothing, not even as those batteries came right down in his face. Hed just stood there and taken it. Hed been a real man about it in his way, Maurice.</div></body></html>';

In some jacked way, I was kinda relieved, especially since, by the time that Friday rolled around, I felt like Id survived a week at war. Watkins had never been this bad, not even when Id first gotten there and didnt know a damn soul. People treated me like I was the scum of the earth, the lowest of the low. Itd been a whole lot better when theyd just ignored me, or called me fat and moved on with their lives. But now there seemed to be an intensity of focus on me, everywhere I went. Every class, every hallway,  every stairwell: always those horrible whispers, that cackling laughter. Even that kid Jamal had laughed in my face when Id run into him in the seventh-grade bathroom after one of my lunches in there. <i>Jamal</i>. I wouldve kicked his ass, but I just didnt have the energy. I didnt have the energy for much of anything anymore.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_020_r1.jpg" alt="020" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">So yeah, when I got to Lizs that Friday afternoon, it almost felt likeI dont knowa homecoming in a way. Even if it was because she was paid to do it, Liz was at least nice to me. Or didnt laugh at me. And at this point Id take whatever I could get.</div><div class="tx">My face mustve told the tale all right because when I walked in there, she didnt start in on me right away like  she usually did. She just gave me a kinda sad smile and moved over to her mini-fridge to get me my PQ. This time I opened it right away. After all my lunches in the handicapped stall, I was hungry pretty much around the clock.</div><div class="tx">So, how was the rest of the week in school? Liz asked me, but gently, as if she already knew what the answer would be.</div><div class="tx">I lifted my shoulders and bowed my head.</div><div class="tx">That bad, huh?</div><div class="tx">Yeah, I said. As bad as it gets.</div><div class="tx">Im sorry to hear that, she said. Are you spending this weekend at your dads, I assume?</div><div class="tx">I shook my head. Nah.</div><div class="tx">But this is one of your scheduled weekends, isnt it? Liz persisted, I have no idea why.</div><div class="tx">I mean, yeah, I was glad shed decided not to grill me about the details of what had gone down at Watkins, but I really didnt understand what my dad had to do with anything. Ive got shit to do around here, I told her. This weekend my mom needs my help doing some stuff around the house, so I said Id stay. And besides, I told you me and him dont work on a strict calendar like that. I go when it works. When it doesnt, I dont.</div><div class="tx">What kind of stuff are you planning to do with your mom? Liz asked. I looked over at her suspiciously. I wondered for the first time how much she knew. Did she know what my mom and Evelyn had discussed over dinner on Monday night?</div><div class="tx">I took a deep breath and figured I might as well tell Liz. It was easier than getting into the nitty-gritty of what had gone down at Watkins all week. And so I began.</div><div class="tx">My mom has this friend, I said carefully. Evelyn her name is? Anyway, she helps out when my moms working, and sometimes she comes by and picks me up here after my sessions with you. I stopped and waited, for what I dont know.</div><div class="tx">Yes, Liz said, I believe Ive seen her a few times when Ive closed up behind you. I admit Ive wondered who she was to you.</div><div class="tx">Who she was to me. Liz had a funny way of putting shit sometimes. Who was Evelyn to me, anyway? I had no clue. Yeah, well, I said, when they came home from dinner on Monday, they told me . . . well, they told me theyd decided that Evelyn would be moving in with us. To save money and shit like that. Plus, my mom thought that I should have someone else around to help monitor my every move.</div><div class="tx">I see, Liz said. She hadnt blinked: It was like Id  just told her my mom had ordered pizza for dinner. No reaction at all.</div><div class="tx">And it sure feels like Evelyns around 24-7 as it is, but she lives all the way out in Hempstead. And the hospital they both work at is a lot closer to our place, and Mom said there was no use in her driving all the way out here when she could just as easily . . . I broke off, trying to figure out what came next. It was all so jumbled-up in my mind. Anyway, well, the thing is, our placethe apartment my mom and I live in, right?well, its only two bedrooms, if you know what Im saying.</div><div class="tx">Liz nodded again, but she still showed no signs of being all that blown away by, or even all that interested in, what I was telling her. Did I really have to spell it out for her even clearer? But then she did the dirty work for me. She looked me straight in the eyes and said, What youre saying is that Evelyn will be moving into your mothers bedroom.</div><div class="tx">I felt my face go all hot as those same humiliating tears sprang to the corners of my eyes. Yes, thats what I was saying, I said in the quietest ever voice. I was having trouble understanding why Liz didnt seem a little more into what I was telling herI mean, this must feel like a big breakthrough, right? But she just seemed kinda bored by the whole thing. It made no sense.</div><div class="tx">My moms been happy as shit all week, I said. Humming in the shower and all that. I mean, this has been the worst damn week of my whole life, and shes walking around like shes just been made queen or something. I paused, shuddered. Its disgusting.</div><div class="tx">I see, Liz said for the millionth time, still nodding over and over. So this angers you, does it? Your mothers happiness?</div><div class="tx">Damn, lady, havent you been listening to a single word Ive said? No, it doesnt <i>anger</i> me. Its just that the one time in my whole life I might want my mom to be around a little, shes just completely checked out, and this time she cant blame her school or her job or all her other stupid-ass attempts to improve our shitty lives, know what I mean? I mean, its bad enough that she . . . But if people found out about her, if . . . whatever the word you usedher <i>happiness</i>got out, it would ruin me at Watkins, dont you understand that? I mean, if it were possible for my life to be any more ruined than it already is, which it isnt. Everything thats already happened to me out here would be a joke in comparison, you have no idea.</div><div class="tx">I hope Liz didnt see me cringe as I all of a sudden remembered the months before we left Harlem and came out here. I used to hear her in the shower a lot then, too,  but it was a whole different sound. Not whistling, but more like crying. Shed gone in there just about every morning, it felt like, while my dad was still sleeping and I was still pretending to sleep, and shed just bawl and bawl like the whole world was coming to an end right in front of her. After shed calm down and Id go out into the kitchen, shed come in like everything was totally normal. And even though our apartment was a shoebox, Id act like everything was normal, too, like I didnt know what was going on in the bathroom, just like Id act like I didnt hear the way she and my dad screamed and carried on till past midnight every night. And even though both of us were pretty good at pretending stuff was okay, I guess we both knew it couldnt go on that way forever.</div><div class="tx">And it hadnt.</div><div class="tx">When is your moms friend moving in? Liz asked.</div><div class="tx">This weekend, I said. Kinda interesting, dont you think? I mean, its almost like theyd made the big decision a whole lot earlier than this past Monday. I shook my head and went on, And now, as part of my punishment for getting beat up, Im supposed to spend all of tomorrow and Sunday lugging all of Evelyns shit over from Hempstead. My moms acting like shes being all generous to let me out of the apartment at all when we  all know its just that shes too cheap to hire a real mover. But hey, I guess its something to do.</div><div class="tx">Liz nodded, but it didnt seem like she had anything to add.</div><div class="tx">Well, that made two of us then.</div></body></html>';

Liz asked when I got to her office on Monday afternoon.</div><div class="tx">It was fine, I said. And it was, at least compared to some other shit. Anything to stay the hell away from Watkins and, wellthe other thing I just couldnt think about. Not now, maybe not ever. I suddenly noticed Liz looking at me funny, so I added quickly, I mean, it ended up being a lot less work than my mom had made out.</div><div class="tx">Evelyns place in West Hempstead had been tinya single room with barely any furniture in it. The whole studio was white and simple and clean, like a set from a European movie or something. My moms furniture,  a lot of which shed dragged up from Philly after my grandmas funeral, was all heavy and dark and way too big for our apartment.</div><div class="tx">My thighs are sore as shit, though, I said. I hadnt got that much exercise since they shut down P.E. at my old school in Harlem. But yeah, the good thing was that we finished up Saturday afternoon, and to thank me for all my help, my mom said I could choose any restaurant I wanted. So I picked Houstons over in the Roosevelt Field mall because Id always wanted to try that place. And, I didnt add, it was on the other side of town from Watkins, so no chance of our running into any familiar faces.</div><div class="tx">Was it good? Liz said.</div><div class="tx">I shrugged. Yeah, it was all right. I got a big burger and some apple-walnut cobbler for dessert, and yeah, I liked it just fine. The funny thing is that Evelyn got a burger, too. A bacon cheeseburger.</div><div class="tx">Whys that funny? Liz wanted to know.</div><div class="tx">Oh, just because shes always making these crazy vegetable stews that look like vomit and have no fat or taste or anything. But yeah, she ate up every bite of that burger and half of my moms fries, too. Tiny lady like that, I didnt know she had it in her.</div><div class="tx">It sounds like you really had fun, Liz said.</div><div class="tx">I didnt say I had <i>fun</i>, I corrected her. I said it was all right, especially since we finished up early and I got to eat a real meal for a change. But yeah, my mom was all laughing and shit, and I guess Evelyn isnt so bad when she lets herself loosen up a little. Most of the time, she walks around like theres a big baseball bat rammed up her ass.</div><div class="tx">Liz smiled, then quickly pretended she hadnt. It was good one of us had something to smile about because it sure wasnt me.</div><div class="tx">By yesterday everything was pretty much back to normal, I went on. My mom got called into work before Id even woken up, and I spent the whole day locked up in that apartment while Evelyn ran around arranging shit and ignoring me unless she needed help moving furniture. I like it better when I can just chill there by my own self, you know what I mean? And Evelyn dont talk much when my moms not around, I said. Its weird. She likes watching TV, though, and thats good because my moms all psycho about that shit and never lets me.</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">In fact, the first thing Id noticed when I walked into Evelyns place in West Hempstead was the big shelf filled with DVDs. She had a ton of them, more than Id ever seen outside the video storea bunch of classics, plus plenty of  shit Id never heard of before. I hadnt been able to hide how surprised Id been. I never knew you liked movies, I said.</div><div class="tx">Evelyn just shrugged, her face expressionless as ever. Well, you never asked, did you?</div><div class="tx">I had no response and just turned to check out the sweet TV set Evelyn had hooked up to the wall. It was flatscreen, and like fifty inches across. Damn. I sure hoped thatd be making the move to Garden City with us.</div><div class="tx">No way I spend that much on a TV and live without cable, Evelyn had said at Houstons that night, and I loved how pissed my mom was. But she was halfway through her second glass of sparkling wine and not much in the mood to throw down.</div><div class="tx">Just as long as were clear that my son wont be watching trash when Im not around, my mom mumbled. Hes got enough problems already.</div><div class="tx">Dont worry, Evelyn said. Therere enough high-quality shows on the TV these days to keep him off the streets. Ill make sure Burton only gets exposed to the good stuff.</div><div class="tx">My mouth dropped open. If only Id had a cocktail of my own right then. No way would Evelyn get away with that. She thinks just because shes sharing my moms bed, she can all of a sudden call me by the stupid-ass  name that <i>only</i> my mother was allowed to use, and that was only because I didnt have a choice in the matter?</div><div class="tx">My own father hated my name, and said so whenever he got a chance. Dont know what I was thinking, letting Shari name my only son after her dead granddaddy. But let me tell you, your mom was fine back in the day, and she used it to get whatever she wanted out of my ass.</div><div><br/></div><div class="tx">Were getting cable, I told Liz. And Internet, too. My mom never saw the need for it before, but Evelyn works from home sometimes so she said that was awhat was the word?a non-negotiable. Which seems only fair, I guess. I mean, if this woman is going to come in and ruin my life, I might as well go down watching some HBO, know what I mean?</div><div class="tx">Liz knitted her brow and looked like she was going to say something, but after a moment she changed her mind. Yes, I suppose that is a silver lining, she said. You seem to be adapting well to all these changes, Butterball. I have to say, Im proud of you.</div><div class="tx">You shouldnt be <i>proud</i> of me, I said. Thats the very last thing you should be.</div><div class="tx">What do you mean? Liz said, perking up. She was clearly pumped.</div><div class="tx">But I only shook my head and didnt say anything. <i>Dont blow it now, Butterball.</i> Liz was this close to writing me a good report. As long as she didnt find out what had happened in the cafeteria that day, I was fine with her thinking whatever she wanted about me.</div><div class="tx">But then, Im not sure why, I couldnt help myself.</div><div class="tx">I found out today that I beat up Maurice for no reason at all. I meanthe reason I thought Id beat him up turned out to be wrong. And I dont know why, but I feel like crap about it.</div><div class="tx">Liz pursed her lips and looked at me with a little sideways smile. Theres never any right reason to beat someone up, Butterball. Whatever Maurice did, beating him up was not the answer.</div><div class="tx">But arent you listening to me? I said. He didnt <i>do</i> anything, thats what Im trying to tell you. Whatever, never mind. I shouldnt have said anything.</div><div class="tx">For what its worth, Liz said, Im really glad you did.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, whatever, I said.

Okay, so maybe I only made the decision when I got to the vending machine and saw that no one had restocked the cheese crackers Id polished off on Friday. Knowing that it was pizza day was also a factor: If there was one thing the cafeteria staff at Watkins knew how to make, it was pizza. No way I could make it through math and social studies without getting my hands on at least a slice or four.</div><div class="tx">Anyway, Id already faced off with Andres and the rest a couple more times in the hall, and they seemed to have lost interest in me, at least for now. I still waited until  about twenty minutes into the periodwhen all the lines wouldve died down and most of the popular eighth-graders wouldve drifted outside to the playgroundto head into the hot-food area. Id grab my food and get out of there fast, no reason to put myself on display any longer than I needed to.</div><div class="tx">Id just gotten in line and taken a couple of chocolate milks when I spotted that little kid Jamal and his fat sidekick, whose name I suddenly remembered was Shaun. I was still planning to whup Jamal for laughing at me in the bathroom last week and just hadnt gotten around to it yet.</div><div class="tx">So I was glaring over at Jamal when his fatass friend Shaun took the last four slices of pizza under the heat lamp. Man, my chest tightened up when I saw thatthats what I get for showing up so late with all the other rejects. Of all the bitches to steal my lunch out from under me!</div><div class="tx">I was about to step forward when out of nowhere Miss Stipler popped out of the line and tapped Shaun right on the shoulder. The woman whod come closest to ruining my life had been standing right in front of me, and I hadnt even noticed. She was so small that even Jamal looked big and tough next to her.</div><div class="tx">Excuse me, son? Miss Stipler said to Shaun. Does your mother know what youre having for lunch today?</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_021_r1.jpg" alt="021" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">Nah, I dont think so, Shaun said, looking embarrassed.</div><div class="tx">Because right there, what youve got on your tray there, thats more saturated fat than youre supposed to consume in a whole week. If you dont watch yourself, youve got a diabetes diagnosis in your future, do you know that?</div><div class="tx">Im sorry, maam, Shaun mumbled. I waswell, I was getting all those slices to share with my friend here, aint that right? He nudged Jamal in the side, and it took Jamal a second to catch on.</div><div class="tx">Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, Jamal said quickly. Yeah, we always get two each.</div><div class="tx">Well, I suppose thats an improvement then, Miss Stipler said. So Ill let it slide this one time only. But  listen, guys, if you ever have any questions about this kind of thing, I run a little informal nutrition clinic out of my classroom during my off-periods. You can bring your parents in, toogood nutrition starts at home, so theres a lot of benefit in you all getting educated together.</div><div class="tx">I felt a lump rising in my throat, and my skin got very hot. What was goingwhat was shewas what I thought was happening really happening?</div><div class="tx">Hey! Whats your problem, boy? I said move it or lose it!</div><div class="tx">I nearly jumped out of my skin to see the hairnetted woman behind the counter yelling at me. She was gesturing angrily at the brand-new pepperoni pizza that had just been placed in front of her. You want some food or you just standing here for the view?</div><div class="tx">Oh, I squeaked out. Sorry, sorry. Yeah, Ill have . . . I looked at the pie and then back in front of me. Jamal, Shaun, and Miss Stipler were all moving out toward the lady who swipes everyones meal cards, and I dont think any of them had even noticed me behind them. Ill have two slices of the pepperoni, please.</div><div class="tx">I took the plate she thrust at me, but somehow I wasnt feeling all that hungry anymore. Even the smell made me sick.</div></body></html>';

I looked down at my lap. My big, baggy-jeans, fat-kid lap. What would youve done in my place, Liz? I asked suddenly.</div><div class="tx">Liz blinked. Shed been staring at me so intensely it made my skin crawl, like she was in a trance or something. What do you mean exactly, Butterball, in your place? I believe, as I said, that theres never a time or a place for beating anyone up. Whatever the problem you have with someone, violence is never the answer.</div><div class="tx">I get that, I said slowly, and I was really starting  to. But thats not what I mean. Or not exactly. Whats done is done, but now I seeI mean, I understand that nothing really went down the way I thought. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes, then drew my hands to my temples as if to block out the nonexistent glare in that dark-ass room.</div><div class="tx">I started up again after a long pause. See, the thing is, I thought Maurice had been telling stories about me. Really bad, nasty stories. Whether those stories had any truth in them is beside the point. Truth doesnt matter so much at Watkins; its what people say about you that counts, know what I mean? And I was pretty sure that if Maurice kept telling his stories, life as I knew it would be over in a big way. So I did what any decent man would do in the circumstances, and I took the necessary steps to protect myself. You following me? I said, but I still didnt look up.</div><div class="tx">I heard Liz make an mm-hmm sound and went on, But now I find out, in the most random possible way, that Maurice never told stories about me to anyone. So when I went over and clocked him on the playground that day, he had no idea what was coming. And all afternoon, I keep replaying the moment over and over, and I see that stunned look on his face, and it doesnt make me  mad anymore like it used to. It makes me . . . sad, you know?</div><div class="tx">And as I spoke I felt the shaming splash of warm liquid sliding down my cheeks, but I no longer cared all that much what Liz thought about me. Everybody else, yeah, but not Liz, not right then. I was just too tired to give a shit anymore. Tired, andthat word againreally, really sad. I was wrong, and theres nothing I can do about it anymore.</div><div class="tx">Liz didnt interrupt to say that of <i>course</i> there was something I could do about it, and I was grateful to her for that. We both knew it wasnt true, so what wouldve been the point? I wasnt playing games, so neither was she. I mean, Maurice doesnt even go to Watkins anymore, you know? One semester left of junior high and hes gotta start over somewhere else. And the thing is, Maurice was my friend. Yeah, part of the reason was because I didnt have any better choices, but still. He was the only one who ever bothered to be nice to me at that shitty-ass school, and <i>this</i> is how I repay him? Man, Im a bigger piece of shit than I thought.</div><div class="tx">Youre not a piece of shit, Butterball, Liz saidfirst time shed spoken in what felt like an eternity.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, I am, I said. But at least now I know it, right?</div><div class="tx">Would my dad still be proud of me if he found out why I did what I didmeaning, no reason at all? Knowing him, probably. But for some reason, that wasnt much consolation. The more I thought about that whole day on the playground, the lower I felt.</div><div class="tx">A few minutes later, as I pounded down the stairwell outside of Lizs office, I realized that she hadnt asked me, not even once, about the stories Maurice had told about me. Or hadnt told, as it turned out. And that, I decided, was pretty cool of her. She knew when to be nosy and when, as they say, enough was enough.</div></body></html>';

Evelyn had listed the cabinet where my mom kept her old TV and the actual TV, too, on craigslist on Saturday night, and shed sold that shit before wed woken up on Sunday.</div><div class="tx">When I got back from Lizs, this young guy and his wife had come by to pick up their purchases, and theyd seemed real excited to be getting such a good deal, never mind that the TV was ten years old and weighed more than most pianos. They paid Evelyn with a stack of twenties, and after I helped the guy lug his loot down four flights of stairs, she peeled one off the top and handed it to me: my cut, she called it. I wasnt sure what my  mom would think of that, but I just nodded thank-you and went right to my Batman box where I stashed my laptop fund.</div><div class="tx">With the big-ass cabinet out of her way, Evelyn had really gone to town decorating and spent the whole evening rearranging shit till it was just right. She was pretty anal, but by the time she was done, the apartment had never seemed so spacious or comfortable. For a second I thought I might almost have been proud to bring Maurice here. A second after that I felt sick to my stomach again.</div><div class="tx">There were still half-unpacked boxes stacked all over the place, so I didnt really notice the white box in the middle of Evelyns glass coffee table. I just pushed it aside with my feet as I kicked them up onto the table.</div><div class="tx">I reached for the remote, but I guess the Time Warner guy hadnt shown up because when I pressed the power button, only black-and-white static appeared on the screen.</div><div class="tx">I shut the TV right back off and just sat there, trying to figure out what to say to the woman who was running around our kitchen like she belonged in there. Evelyn worked a more regular shift schedule than my mom, so me and her would probably be spending all sorts of time  together from here on out. I wasnt too sure how I felt about that.</div><div class="tx">After a few minutes, Evelyn walked in with a plate of food in each hand. I saw her glance at my sneakers and the big smudges they were making on her coffee table, but she decided not to say anything. She sat down on the couch next to me and passed a plate over. Then, after thinking about it for a second, she kicked her own feet onto the table, right on the other side of that white box from mine.</div><div class="tx">Burton, she begandamn, there she went again! I wanted to talk to you about something your mom and Ive been discussing these past couple of days. Would that be all right with you?</div><div class="tx">Instead of answering, I started in on the plate of meatballs shed brought me. I had to admit they were pretty good. Evelyn was clearly trying to get on my good side, or she wouldnt have cooked a dinner I actually liked. So why couldnt she just let me enjoy the meal in peace?</div><div class="tx">Evelyn seemed real nervous, probably because she wasnt used to carrying much weight in any conversation. She had that in common with my mom, who shed just mentioned for the first time. . . . And Shari wanted me to make it clear that this shouldnt be seen as a bribe or anything like that . . .</div><div class="tx">I looked over at Evelyn, whod been talking on and on. A bribe? A bribe for what?</div><div class="tx">And it just so happened that theyre updating the data systems at St. Vincents, and whenever that happens, all the administrative leads are given the opportunity to buy back their old work computers at cost. And well, your moms always talking about how you want some way to edit your movies, so I offered to . . .</div><div class="tx">Evelyn reached forward to the white box that was between us on the coffee table. And all of a sudden I realized what it was, and what exactly she was saying to me.</div><div class="tx">Its a couple of years old, but it still works great. And I got the IT guy to wipe the hard drive this morning, so theres a lot of storage space and you can put pretty much any program you want on there . . .</div><div class="tx">I threw my plate of meatballs down on the couch next to me and grabbed at the box Evelyn was holding. Id seen that kinda box before, and I couldnt even believe this was happening. It was a Mac. A Mac laptop, and it was mine. Damn.</div><div class="tx">They use Macs at the hospital? I asked because I wouldnt have expected that of a ghetto place like St. Vincents, but then what did I know?</div><div class="tx">Without waiting for an answer, I opened the box and  pulled out the laptop. It was white, not one of those sleek titanium jobs that the DJs use, but stillI wouldve had to make my bed ten times a day for a year to afford that shit on my own. Man, this was just unreal.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_022_r1.jpg" alt="022" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">So I guess you like it? I heard Evelyn say.</div><div class="tx">Oh, yeah, shit, sorry, I said. Yeah, I love it, for real. Thanks so much.</div><div class="tx">No problem at all, Evelyn said, and she almost sounded as happy as I felt. But remember, its not a bribe, all right? The timing just happened to work out, and with all the money well be saving on rent, paying for it wasnt really a problem. I just thought since youre grounded and all, youll have some extra time on your hands.</div><div class="tx">I nodded. Right then I didnt care that I was grounded or who was reminding me of it because Id rather spend time on this computer thanwhat? Hang out with the friends I didnt have? Get my face kicked in again?</div><div class="tx">Thanks, Evelyn, I said, and if shed only said my name for the first time the previous day, I dont think Id ever used hers to her face before, not even once. Thanks a whole lot.</div></body></html>';

There was just no way I was going to sit for an hour smelling that shit. Maybe if Id had my computer, I couldve ignored the stench and gotten down to work, but Id never bring that laptop within three blocks of Watkins. This school was so ghetto, itd be jacked before homeroom let out.</div><div class="tx">So, finally, I decided: Screw it. Id go back to the cafeteria again, and this time Id actually eat. I got myself a tray of fish sticks and was just walking toward my old  table in the back when Andres slammed right into me. Oops, sorry about that, he said, but he didnt sound all that sorry. And to prove it, he swiped his hand across my tray and sent a couple of the fish sticks flying.</div><div class="tx">Get outta my way, I mumbled under my breath. I was mad, but I wasnt in the mood to start nothing with him. Not now, not ever.</div><div class="tx">Whatd you say? Andres asked, real loud, so that everyone who wasnt already staring at us swiveled around to tune in. Were you crying again, or did you have something you wanted to say to me?</div><div class="tx">Nah, I said. I just wanna go eat.</div><div class="tx">No shit? Andres said. But then I guess you dont get a hot body like yours without doing a lot of eating, do you?</div><div class="tx">I guess not, I said and moved to walk around him.</div><div class="tx">Ah, I was just kidding, Butterball man. I just wanted to see if you wanted to come sit with us today? He gestured over to his table where Darrell and Bobbie were sitting and staring right at us. We havent seen you around much lately and just wanted to see what was up.</div><div class="tx">Andres was definitely up to something, and whatever it was couldnt be good. Hed already wasted enough of my time, so I just said Nah again and tried to walk around him.</div><div class="tx">Im serious, Butterball, man, me and the boys wanted to rap a little with you. Whatcha doing after school today?</div><div class="tx">Im busy making movies, I said without thinking and immediately felt stupid. I never talked about that shit, and even if I had, Andres was the last person on earth I wouldve told. Every day, it seemed like I was giving him another reason to make fun of my ass.</div><div class="tx">And sure enough, Andres cracked up once hed processed what Id said. Making <i>movies</i>, did I hear you right? Movies of whatyou eating a fried chicken? Or, I know, how about a whole action sequence that shows you pissing down your leg?</div><div class="tx">The kids at the next table laughed their asses off at this, but I feltnothing at all. It was almost like I was immune. I just left Andres standing there and started walking in a straight line till I reached the back corner table where Maurice and I had sat for so much of seventh grade. When Jamal and Shaun saw me coming, they made a move to get up, but I shook my head and took a seat at the opposite end of the table. I felt them watching me nervously, but I just didnt feel up to getting into it with anyone right then. Instead I started to house what was left of my fish sticks. But somehow, I cant really explain why, they didnt taste half as good as they used to.</div></body></html>';

Just a couple more weeks to go and Watkins would be behind me forever, and youd better believe I was counting down every single hour.</div><div class="tx">By that Thursday, my face had healed up almost all the way, and people had gotten bored of checking me out and whispering shit whenever I walked down the hall. It was like Id gone back to those first months of seventh grade, before I got to know Maurice, when I drifted through my days silent and invisible.</div><div class="tx">For some reason, though, I no longer minded my  invisibility all that much. Being ignored was a gift, and probably the only reason Id started to look forward to high school. Most kids at Watkins got fed into Clara Barton High, which was an even bigger school, with students from Roosevelt and Hempstead, too. Maybe itd be easier to get lost in the crowd again. I was betting on it.</div><div class="tx">After school on Thursday, I was supposed to head right back to the apartment to wait for the Time Warner guy, who after like a dozen rescheduled appointments was finally supposed to show up to hook up our TV and Internet between four and seven. But it was sunny and warm out, and Id been cooped up inside all day since I never went out on the playground after lunch anymore. I sorta just wanted to enjoy the sunshine and delay my return to another long afternoon alone in the apartment.</div><div class="tx">So when school let out at three fifteen, I wandered over to the side door that connected Watkins to Washington Irving Elementary School. It was the same exit Nia and I had taken when wed walked to OfficeMax what felt like a lifetime ago. I thought Id go check out what those elementary-school kids were up tomaybe Id find something to shoot, though that was never all that likely here in Garden City.</div><div class="tx">Id just walked out onto Franklin, video camera in  hand, just kinda scoping the scene, when I saw that little kid Malik from the basement of my building. I hadnt known he went to Irving, but I guess it made sense, there not being a whole lot of educational options in this town.</div><div class="tx">Malik was pretty hard to miss that afternoon. He was standing on the front steps of Irving, hopping from foot to foot, moving up and down the stairs like his sneakers had wings. Freaky as he looked out there, I had to admit the brother was nimble. It really did look like he was flying. For I dont know how long I just stood there, watching my little neighbor move. Id seen him pull this shit on the stoop sometimes, but this was different: This was right in front of his entire elementary school. And he wasnt embarrassed at all. It was like he didnt care who was watching. Wish Id been more like that when I was in fourth grade.</div><div class="tx">A few minutes into Maliks performance, this big guy walked right up to him and started clapping his hands together real loud. Man, oh, man, youre better than the homeless guy I saw outside the Sunglass Hut last week! Collect any good tips? he asked in this big booming voice, and a couple of other kids gathered around to watch.</div><div class="tx">Malik, whod stopped dancing, shook his head and  backed away from the guy. Damn, he looked scared. Malik was an average-size kid, but next to the guy hassling him, he looked tiny and vulnerable and so sorta crushable.</div><div class="tx">I said, you collect any tips, twinkle toes? the guy repeated even louder, and he was right up in Maliks face now.</div><div class="tx">Malik kept on shaking his head even as he dug into his pocket and pulled out a couple of wadded-up dollar bills, which the bigger kid snatched right off him.</div><div class="tx">And before Id thought about what I was doing, I moved forward until I was standing right between Malik and the guy whod been bothering him. The guy was big, yeah, but only by elementary-school standards. At Watkins an asshole like him wouldnt last a minute.</div><div class="tx">Give him his money back, I heard myself saying. Now.</div><div class="tx">The guy didnt move, just shook his head at me. I stared him right in the eyes and read him inside and out. He wasnt nearly as tough as he was pretending to be. I was at least two years older, and I had the weight advantage. And maybe most importantly I had nothing at all to lose.</div><div class="tx">Did you hear me? I said, my voice all low and threatening. I said give him his money back. <i>Now</i>.</div><div class="tx">The guy glanced from me to Malik, as if to see if I was kidding. When it became clear that I wasnt, he shrugged and passed the dollar bills back to Malik.</div><div class="tx">Good boy, I said. Now get your ass outta here. Then, before he could make a clean escape, I looked him straight in the eyes again and added, And dont let me <i>ever</i> catch you hassling Malik again, aight? Pick on somebody your own size or Ill make sure youll regret it.</div><div class="tx">The guy nodded quickly and then scampered off like Id just shot at him. About the only thing he hadnt done was wet his pants, not that I of all people could judge him if he had.</div><div class="tx">Once the guy was gone, Malik looked over at me, as confused as hed been frightened only a second before. Thanks, he said. That wasthat was really nice of you.</div><div class="tx">I shrugged. You going back to Palace Houses? I asked. Because thats what the crappy five-story walkup where we lived was called.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, Malik said uncertainly. I guess so.</div><div class="tx">All right then, I said. Lets go.</div><div class="tx">We hadnt walked five steps toward the sidewalk before I saw her. Nia. She was standing right there, staring at me with those dark eyes.</div><div class="tx">Hi, Butterball, she said, and her voice was different than it had been at the 7-Eleven. It was softer, kinder, more like the old Nia from art class.</div><div class="tx">I mustve shown how taken aback I was when I asked, Whatre you doing here?</div><div class="tx">Two of my little sisters go to Irving, she said. I pick them up on the days they dont have dance.</div><div class="tx">Oh, I said. Thats cool.</div><div class="tx">Nia was looking curiously at Malik, as if trying to figure out who he was to me, but I was feeling way too unsteady to get into it right then.</div><div class="tx">Cmon, Malik, lets go, I said, and he followed me like a little puppy dog.</div><div class="tx">About a block past Irving, he said again, That was really cool what you did back there. I mean itI really, um, owe you for that.</div><div class="tx">Dont worry about it, I said. I already had some ideas of how he could pay me back. Hey, when we get back to Palace, would you mind showing me some of those moves again?</div></body></html>';

I had a cool movie idea yesterday. Now that I had my computer, I was already thinking bigger: I didnt just have to stop with those quickie two-minute videos I shot on the street.</div><div class="tx">Thats fantastic news, Butterball! Liz exclaimed. Id love to hear about it.</div><div class="tx">Well, I wouldnt love to talk about it, I said. But then, realizing how that had sounded, I added, I mean, Im just kinda superstitious about that shit. Like talking about it too early might end up cursing the whole project, you know?</div><div class="tx">I understand, Liz said, and she didnt seem offended at all. If you ever need anyone to sound ideas off, you can always try me out, all right?</div><div class="tx">I nodded. Sure, sounds good.</div><div class="tx">And speaking of ideas, Liz said carefully, I was sort of playing around with one I had about your future.</div><div class="tx">She waited, and I looked at her, no idea what she was talking about. Are you about to bump me up to even more sessions a week? I asked.</div><div class="tx">No, actually, Butterball, she said, I think well cancel our Friday appointment and meet again on Monday, and take it on a week-by-week basis from there. What I was actually wondering was if youve ever considered a magnet school for next year.</div><div class="tx">A magnet school? I snorted. You mean like Bronx Science where all the nerds in Harlem get shipped off to?</div><div class="tx">Liz thought about this. Well, yes and no, she said. There are other types of magnet schools all over the place, for all sorts of different studentspeople interested in entering law enforcement, all types of things. The particular one I was thinking of is in Floral Park, for kids interested in careers in the arts.</div><div class="tx">The woman had my attention, even if I still couldnt figure out why she was telling me all this.</div><div class="tx">Now, the deadline for most of these schools has passed, she was saying, but I do have some pull in the Nassau County school district. So if you were interested in having a look, I might be able to, you know, put in a good word for you.</div><div class="tx">But why would you do that? I asked, more confused than ever. Its not like I make good grades or anything, especially this past semester when shits gotten all messed up.</div><div class="tx">Its not really about grades at Cunningham, Liz said. I mean, certainly, grades help, but the bigger emphasis is on creativity. And, you know, creativedirection. Kids who have big dreams and whod benefit from an environment that supports those dreams.</div><div class="tx">But youve never even seen my shit before, I said, more and more baffled by her gibberish. I mean, you dont even know if Im any good or not.</div><div class="tx">But I do know that youre serious, Liz said, and at this point, that counts as much, or even more, than anything. I mean, youre in eighth grade, Butterball. No one expects you to be Ingmar Bergman at this point, or even Christopher Nolan.</div><div class="tx">I raised my eyebrows, surprised old Liz had even heard of Ingmar. I was also kinda flattered shed remembered  what Id said about Christopher Nolan. Sometimes when Id sit on that nasty couch rambling on and on, Id wonder how much Liz was actually absorbing from behind those librarian glasses. In a way, thinking she might be tuning me out the way I tuned out Mrs. Fleming in math sometimes made it easier for me to talk.</div><div class="tx">And then I thought of something else. But didnt you say the school was in Floral Park? Isnt that like halfway back to the city? Theres no way thatd fly with my mom, especially if she passes all her nursing exams this summer and gets put on an official rotation.</div><div class="tx">Yes, Liz said, Cunninghamthe schools official name is the Merce Cunningham High School for the Performing and Visual Artsis about a forty-five-minute drive from here. But there are trains that go right there, and the school also provides some limited transportation subsidies if they want you enough.</div><div class="tx">I sighed. There was the problem right there: wanting me enough. Seemed like no one ever did. Liz mustve seen the look on my face because she got up off her chair and started moving toward me. I instinctively shrank into the couch, but it turned out Liz didnt have hugging on her mind. She reached out her hand and passed me a stapled-together stack of papers.</div><div class="tx">Here, she said, Ive printed out the prospectus and a bunch of application materials. You can have a look over the weekend and talk it over with your mom to see what she thinks. Im not making any promises, so dont get your hopes up. But I do think Cunningham could be a good opportunity for you. A fresh start might be just what you need.</div><div class="tx">I looked down at the pages shed handed me, and my eyes blurred up. <i>Afresh start:</i> the exact same words my mom kept repeating the summer after sixth grade, when shed moved out on my dad without even settling on where we were going next. Yeah, well, look at all the good my last fresh start had done me.</div><div class="tx">But all I said to Liz was, Yo, thanks. Ill definitely have a look. Because when it came down to it, I really didnt have much to lose anymore.</div></body></html>';

I didnt know public schools like that even existed. The place had a budget and teachersthe brochure kept calling them professorswho were real leaders in their fields, and they gave kids grants to put on theater productions and dance performances and, yes, even film movies, and they set up internships with real professionals in the city, people Id actually heard of. The place was unreal.</div><div class="tx">Now, if only I had a chance in hell of getting in there.</div><div class="tx">The application was like fourteen pages long, way more detailed than the packets Mom had filled out to  get into nursing school. The first night, I filled out all the easy stuff: name, address, Social Security number, that kind of thing. But after that I got stuck.</div><div class="tx">There were all these questions, page after page of them, that I was supposed to answer in my own words, whatever that meant. Why did I want to go to Cunningham? Well, two hours earlier Id never even heard of the place, but now ... What did I think Id gain from the experience? Pretty much everything and then some. What were my artistic aspirations? Huh?</div><div class="tx">But the hardest part of all was the work sample they required all applicants to submit. Still photographs, paintings, a short film ... Were there really thirteen-year-olds out there who had professional artists portfolios?</div><div class="tx">I lay on my bed, staring up at the ceiling, before the idea came to me: Malik. Id already shot some stuff with my downstairs neighbor, but why not draw it out a little, make a whole movie out of it? I jumped off my bed and went over to my laptop to start mapping it out. First thing the next morning, I was dressed and waiting outside the door of Maliks apartment.</div></body></html>';

I knew as much as I knew anything that it was solid, maybe even good. I called it <i>The Superhero of Suburbia</i>, and it was about a quiet, friendless kid whos always struggling to keep his superpowerthe ability to fly in broad daylighta secret. The stuff he did with his superpower wasnt all that heroic, but that was part of the joke: Instead of rescuing babies from burning buildings, S.o.S. would save suburbanites from getting their cars towed and keeping dogs from crapping on perfect lawns.</div><div class="tx">I used fancy editing tricks to show my downstairs neighbor Malik leaping over sprinkler systems and dancing down mall escalators. And I gotta admit, Id had a good time working with Malik, who could act as well as he could dance. Maybe when the time came, hed apply to Cunningham, too.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_023_r1.jpg" alt="023" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">Itd been Maliks idea to film a bunch of the scenes in Maurices neighborhoodthe big houses there worked a lot better with the plot than the crumbling building where Malik and I lived. All those afternoons we spent in Roydon Oaks, and Id never run into my old friend, not even once. And that, Ill be honest, was a big relief.  I wasnt looking forward to crossing paths with Maurice again, but I knew exactly what Id do if it did happen.</div><div class="tx">Id walk right up to him, look him straight in the eyes, and say, Im sorry. Im not sure what would happen after that, but it was a start, right?</div><div class="tx">As for the other kids at Watkins, well, no matter where I went next year, I was pretty much glad to be done with them once and for all. Except for maybe Nia. Id barely seen her in the last few weeks, but I guess I was the one to blame for that. Id been so obsessed with getting my movie doneand making sure it was goodthat Id pretty much fallen off the face of the earth. I bought a Kryptonite lock for my locker and spent every free period and lunch holed up in the library, reviewing the footage Malik and I had shot the afternoon before.</div><div class="tx">About a week before school let out, I came home one afternoon to find my mom sitting on the couch with a big smile on her face. Lets go out to celebrate when Evelyn gets back in a few minutes, she said. Should we try Houstons again?</div><div class="tx">Sure, that sounds good, I said, a little taken aback. But whatre we celebrating exactly?</div><div class="tx">My mom smiled even wider. Do we really need an excuse? I dont know, I just . . . Well, youre almost done  with junior high, and youve been working so hard on that movie of yours. And I heard from Liz this morning, and shes been very pleased with the progress youve been making. She said that after next Mondays session, you could wind it up for the year, take the summer off.</div><div class="tx">She did? I said. And Im not sure why, but I wasnt completely flooded with relief the way Id expected. I mean, all Id wanted these last few months was for Liz to cut me loose, and now she was doing exactly thatso why wasnt I jumping up and down for joy? For real, what was <i>wrong</i> with me?</div><div class="tx">Yep, Mom said, though she said shell always be around if you ever need some additional sessions. She also mentioned this Cunningham school youve been talking about, honey, and Liz is <i>very</i> optimistic. Or, at least, she said she was really pulling for you.</div><div class="tx">Well, I gotta turn in my application first, I said. But Im almost there; I really am. Hey, hold on, I gotta do something really quick.</div><div class="tx">I took the cordless phoneanother addition from Evelyns apartmentinto my bedroom with me. All of a sudden I was possessed with the urge to call my dad and tell him about my movie and ask him to cross his fingers for my application. I hadnt seen him since the  sneakers trip, which was maybe good since I wasnt all the way prepared to answer any questions he might have about what was going down in our Garden City apartment these days.</div><div class="tx"><i>This Cunningham thing felt big,</i> I thought as I waited for my dad to pick up. It was hard to put it in words exactly. But for once I wasnt just running away from somewhere, which it felt like Id been doing, in some form or another, these last two years. This time I wanted to go <i>to</i> somewhere. And it felt ... good. Scary, but good.</div><div class="tx">When I told my dad about the school, there was a }little silence on the other end of the line. An arts school? he said. Say what? That sounds like its gonna cost me a shitload, and you <i>know</i> I aint trying to hear that.</div><div class="tx">No, no, I said, thats the crazy part. Its a public school. A magnet school, but free like all the others.</div><div class="tx">Well, all right then, my dad said, so long as its not just some other way for your mom to go digging into my paycheck again.</div><div class="tx">The music behind him was still blasting real loud, and I knew he had to be at home in his bedroom. The sound system in there was sick.</div><div class="tx">You need anything else from me? my dad asked after a pause.</div><div class="tx">Nowhat do you mean?</div><div class="tx">I mean, why else you call? You been too busy for me these days, so I figured you had to want something out of me.</div><div class="tx">Oh, no, I said. That was it. I just wanted to tell you I was gonna apply, thats all. For some reason I couldnt bring myself to tell him about the movie after all.</div><div class="tx">All right, well, if thats really it, Dad said, then Id best be getting off the line now if you dont mind. I got a date with destiny tonight, and her name is Angela.</div><div class="tx">I didnt bother asking him what happened to Diane.</div><div class="tx">I guess I didnt really care. My dad obviously didnt give a shit about anything I did, so from then on the feeling would be mutual. All of a sudden it stung me hard, the way hed talked to me, the way he was always talking to me. Id laid it all on the line about Cunningham, talking to him just like a little kid about how bad I wanted to get in there, and he couldnt even find it in himself to say Good luck? Well, screw him then. I was done trying. There were plenty of other places my energy could go.</div><div class="tx">I hung up and went back into the living room, feeling less than great. All the fizz seemed to have gone out of  me. My mom and Evelyn were sitting there dressed and ready to go.</div><div class="tx">Oh, I didnt realize you were back, I said to Evelyn, who just nodded in reply to me. She and I still didnt talk all that much, but it wasnt as strained as it used to be.</div><div class="tx">My mom suggested Houstons again and I wasnt about to disagree, even if my appetite hadnt exactly returned after that phone call. Mom, Evelyn, and I were following the hostess to our booth when my eyes landed right on Nia. She was sitting at the end of a long table surrounded by all her little brothers and sisters.</div><div class="tx">Hey! she called out to me. I had no choice but to stop. I saw no sign of Nias Aunt Cora, so that was something.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_024_r1.jpg" alt="024" class="imgepub"/></div><div class="tx">I could tell my mom and Evelyn were curious, so after Nia introduced me around, I stood real still and braced myself. In the most normal voice I had, I said, Nice to meet everyone. This is my mom, Sheril, and this is her girlfriend, Evelyn. We all came down here to celebrate graduation, I guess just like yall did.</div><div class="tx">Nia let out a little gasp. Then she made a sound like Ah! as her face broke out into a big smile. Like everything made sense to her all of a sudden.</div><div class="tx">I shuffled over to her end of the table while our moms and Evelyn made small talk. So, uh, whatre you up to this summer? I asked Nia.</div><div class="tx">Not much, she said. Just the usual babysitting and hanging out at the Y pool. What about you?</div><div class="tx">Yeah, same, I said. Nothing big. Im hoping to work on some movies and, you know, sort through my shit a little.</div><div class="tx">Nia nodded, but before she could say anything else, I burst out with, Hey, Nia? Can I say something? Im sorry I ruined your party, I really am. I dont know what happened. Its just been ... well, its just been a really hard year for me is all. But thats no excuse. I shouldnt have done what I did. Im doing a lot better now, and Im acting better, too.</div><div class="tx">Nia smiled at meshe really did have the prettiest smile in the world. I understand, Butterball, she said. At least I think I do. And honestly ... its okay. If you hadnt been the one to ruin the party, Im sure someone else wouldve, you know? Thats what my aunt said, anyway, and Coras usually right about everything. I was really mad, Im not gonna lie. But ... I know you didnt mean it deep down.</div><div class="tx">It felt like this huge weight was lifted off my chest. The leftover anger and misery of that phone call with my dad finally trickled away, probably to return sometime, but not as long as Nia was smiling at me. All right then, cool, I managed to say. So it was really good to see you, Nia.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, you, too, she said. She paused as if considering something, then added, And hey, since were both stuck in town all summer, maybe we could get together sometime if you want. Maybe you could help me babysit one of these days?</div><div class="tx">Id like that, I said. I couldnt help it; my whole face broke out in the widest grin of my life. Id like that a whole lot.</div><div class="tx">A few minutes later, as I followed my mom and Evelyn over to our booth, I felt almost sick with happiness. Right then I didnt care who knew what about my mom and her relationship anymore.</div><div class="tx">I think that girl likes you, my mom whispered as we continued on to our table. She was giggling and seemed a lot younger than usual.</div><div class="tx">Ah, shut up, Ma, I said. Shes just nice, thats all. Shes like that with everybody. A girl like that, shed never go for a fat kid like me.</div><div class="tx">But Burton, my mom said, I know youve been too busy to notice, but youre not all that fat anymore.</div><div class="tx">I looked down at the new pants shed bought me for the graduation ceremony and shrugged.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, well, see if you still say that after all the damage Im about to do to this menu, I said, and even Evelyn cracked a smile.</div></body></html>';

On my way over to the couch, I dropped the application packetcomplete with DVDright onto her lap.</div><div class="tx">Liz looked excited as shit. Youve done it? Youve filled everything out?</div><div class="tx">Yep, I said. Its all good to go now. I worked my ass off on the work sample, but Im pretty sure I got it right.</div><div class="tx">Thats wonderful, Liz said. I cant wait to hand it over.</div><div class="tx">Liz spent the next few minutes looking over the pages Id given her. Watching her read my application made  me feel a little uncomfortable, like when somebody unwraps a present youve gotten them in front of you. For some weird reason, I just really wanted Liz to like it.</div><div class="tx">I mean, yeah, I did it kinda fast, I said, but you said Id already missed the deadline, and I didnt want to let any more time pass, you know?</div><div class="tx">Liz was now scanning the pages Id spent so much time filling out the way somebody reads a half-memorized grocery list. And, like, I know its not even close to being perfect, but I think I did an okay job, right? I mean, if I didnt, I can always</div><div class="tx">This all looks just fine to me, Liz said, cutting me off. And then she picked up the DVD Id handed her. And this? she squinted at the label my mom had driven me to the office-supply store to print out. This is your work sample<i>The Superhero of Suburbia</i>?</div><div class="tx">I nodded like I didnt care, but inside I felt shy. Yep, thats the best Ive got. You can watch if you want. Its not dirty or anything like that.</div><div class="tx">Liz smiled. I wasnt suggesting that it was. I love the title, and I hope one day youll let me watch it.</div><div class="tx">You can watch it right now if you want, I said. I mean, not when Im sitting right here, if you dont mind. That would be a little embarrassing.</div><div class="tx">Dont worry, I wouldnt do that to you, Liz said.</div><div class="tx">There was a silence as we sat there looking at each other.</div><div class="tx">So are you sure? I asked. I mean, youre sure I should do this?</div><div class="tx">It was my idea, wasnt it? Liz said. All right, so Ill be sure to put this in the right peoples hands and make a few phone calls, but after that, youre on your own. So <i>please</i> try not to screw anything up, okay?</div><div class="tx">Liz was chuckling as she said this, but I knew she was dead serious. For as long as shed known me, all Id ever done was screw shit up, so it was actually pretty wacked that she was giving me this chance in the first place.</div><div class="tx">My whole life, school had just been a place where I escaped from whatever was going on at home. Before Watkins, nothing all that bad had ever happened at school, but nothing much good went down, either. It was justschool. Four walls and cheap toilet paper and some bad fluorescent lighting where I passed my time five days a week. Whatever happened with Cunningham, it was kinda . . . eye-opening, I guess, to realize that it could actually be something more.</div><div class="tx">There was a silence, and I suddenly realized Lizs eyes were drilling into me. On another subject, you  look like youve lost a little weight lately, Butterball. Am I right?</div><div class="tx">My mom had said the same thing at the restaurant, and I hadnt known how to respond then, either. Yeah, well, Ive skipped a few meals here and there over the last few weeks, I said. Just havent been as hungry as I used to be.</div><div class="tx">I was now sitting diagonally across from Jamal and Shaun every day. The three of us had never exchanged a word, but it was like wed called a sort of truce, an agreement not to interfere with one another. It was working for the moment, or at least it sure beat the handicapped stall.</div><div class="tx">Liz and I spent the next half-hour rapping about nothing in particularthe end of school, how nasty-ass hot it was getting already, our plans for the summer. Id noticed a neatly zipped suitcase in the corner of Lizs office, right by the mini-fridge.</div><div class="tx">Heading out? I asked, pointing over at it.</div><div class="tx">Youre very observant, Butterball, Liz said. Yes, I wasGeorge and I are driving up to Rhode Island for a wedding this weekend, so were taking the whole rest of the week off and making a vacation out of it. Im supposed to pick him up at his office at four. Walk me to the car?</div><div class="tx">I nodded, and we went back out into the parking  lot togetherthe first time Id ever seen Liz outside the confines of her little office. It was bright and sunny out, a different season from when Id started coming to her at the end of that long dreary winter.</div><div class="tx">As we passed the fried-chicken place, I stopped and turned to her. Thanks for helping me out with Cunningham, I said. I wanted to thank her for other stuff, too, but I didnt know how to phrase it exactly. I mean, I really appreciate it.</div><div class="tx">No problem, Liz said. I think youd be very happy there, Butterball.</div><div class="tx">Yeah, me, too, I said. Too bad I have more of a chance of getting a pro basketball contract than getting in.</div><div class="tx">Liz chuckled. Now, I wouldnt say that. Like I said, Ive got friends in high places, and if that DVDs half as good as I think it might be . . .</div><div class="tx">Nah, dont say stuff like that, I said. I dont want to get my hopes up, you know?</div><div class="tx">Its not the worst thing in the world, is it? Getting your hopes up.</div><div class="tx">I wasnt sure what Liz meant by that, so I didnt say anything, just started walking across the lot with her again.</div><div class="tx">So do you have any plans this summer? Liz asked as we made our way across the asphalt.</div><div class="tx">Nope. Just working on my movies and stuff. My mom wanted me to go to a summer program. But I know she doesnt have the cash for that, and Im happy working on my own, or with this neighbor kid who starred in that DVD I gave you. I hesitated for a second, then decided to tell her. But I do have some plans to see that girl I told you about a while backNia, remember?</div><div class="tx">I remember <i>very</i> well, Liz said.</div><div class="tx">Uh, yeah, I said, feeling a little embarrassed. Well, actually what happened is that I ran into her whole family at Houstons the other night. We all got started talking, and, yknow. Everyone got along real good.</div><div class="tx">Thats great, Liz said. Who knows? You could have some summer romance in your future if you play your cards right.</div><div class="tx">Aw, cmon, Liz, I said. Its not like that at all. And it wasnt, but I couldnt tell her what it was like because I really had no idea. And another thing I might doI might ... Well, I was thinking about stopping over at Maurices one day, just to say hey and, like, that Im sorry for everything that happened between us. Do you think thatd be stupid?</div><div class="tx">I dont think thatd be stupid at all, Liz said seriously. Quite the opposite, in fact. Good luck with that, ButterballI hope youll fill me in on how it turns out.</div><div class="tx">We stopped in front of a beat-up red Honda. Just like Id suspected, Liz wasnt exactly raking in the big bucks in the therapy business.</div><div class="tx">It was good to see you again, Butterball, Liz said now, stooping to unlock her car door. Stop by anytime youd like, okay? And remember, if you dont invite me to all your screenings, Im going to write you a bad-conduct report. Promise youll keep me in the loop?</div><div class="tx">I laughed. Yeah, yeah, I promise. I hesitated. I felt like I had one last request to make.</div><div class="tx">Theres . . . just one other thing I wanted to ask you.</div><div class="tx">Liz turned away from her car to look at me. Sure, what is it?</div><div class="tx">It sounds kinda weird, I know, butwell, would you mind calling me Burton from now on? Because ... thats my real name, and thats what Im going to answer to next year, no matter where I go.</div><div class="tx">Now it was Lizs turn to laugh. Of course, Burton. Nothing would please me more. Now have a good weekend, all right?</div><div class="tx">You, too, I said. Have fun in Rhode Island. And for a while after she drove off, I just stood there by myself in the parking lot, watching the sun beat down on the asphalt. Then I took a deep breath in and walked back home.</div><div class="centerAligned"><img src="fift_9781101552292_oeb_025_r1.jpg" alt="025" class="imgepub"/></div></body></html>';

We&#8217;re cleaning the Wilson house and Nat King Cole&#8217;s singing on the record. It sounds fine. This is one of the best places to clean because they have a big yard and no neighbors close enough to hear our ruckus. Otherwise, working on a Sunday would be a real drag. But the Wilsons are gone for the weekend and Mr. Wilson said he&#8217;d pay extra for a clean house when he gets back. With Christmas just a few weeks away, the money will come in handy.</div><div class="tx">I am knee-deep in Murphy Oil Soap, washing Otis Wilson&#8217;s sticky fingerprints off his mama&#8217;s fine oak banister, when Jolene comes waltzing down the stairs with the laundry.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I swear, these people must change their clothes every hour on the hour, every day. I&#8217;ve never seen such a mess of laundry in my life. Ida Mae Jones, hurry up with that polishing and come help me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I am hurrying. If they&#8217;d stop giving Otis jam for breakfast, I wouldn&#8217;t be cleaning this railing every week.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;If they stopped giving Otis jam for breakfast, he&#8217;d cry for a week,&#8221; she says.</div><div class="tx">Otis Wilson is the most spoiled white boy in New Orleans. Just a year younger than Jolene and me, but at seventeen, he&#8217;s still a slobbering mess. Jolene says it&#8217;s because he&#8217;s soft in the head. I think it has more to do with being spoiled.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You think he&#8217;d enlist if we ever join this war?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene laughs her big horse laugh. &#8220;Girl, can you see that little jam jar in a uniform? I mean he&#8217;s big enough, for a white boy, and not bad looking, either, if you like the pasty type, but taking orders and holding a gun&#8212;we&#8217;d be better off surrendering than sending him to fight.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Too true, too true.&#8221; I laugh, thinking about Otis&#8217;s broad-bellied self in a uniform. &#8220;Think they&#8217;ve got maids in the army to wipe the jam off his rifle?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s Jolene&#8217;s turn to chuckle. &#8220;Now stop making me laugh and get to work. We&#8217;re going to have to clean this house a hundred more times if you&#8217;re going to get the money to go to Chicago.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t I know it.&#8221; I sigh. At home, we get by running our little berry farm, but getting by is far from getting rich. Even with cleaning houses full-time since Jolene and I graduated high school in June, the saving is coming slow. Sometimes it seems like my purse is nothing but a sieve with money running through it like water. &#8220;The way I see it, another month of solid work and I&#8217;ll be set. Then all I have to do is find a way to get my mother to let me go to Chicago by myself.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Or work another six months and take her with you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, I can see that now,&#8221; I say, rolling my eyes. &#8220;&#8216;Mama, you wait right here, I&#8217;m gonna go take my pilot&#8217;s test.&#8217; She only lets me fly now because Grandy&#8217;s with me. She hates to fly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Girl, I know better than to tell you to give it up. You&#8217;ve got the flying bug just as sure as your daddy did, but some days I think it&#8217;s more trouble than it&#8217;s worth. More money than it&#8217;s worth, too.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Bessie Coleman had to go all the way to France to learn  how to fly just because she was colored.&#8221; She was one of my idols&#8212;the Negro Amelia Earhart. &#8220;She was nothing more than a hairdresser, but she did it. So why can&#8217;t I? I already know how to fly, Jolene. If I can&#8217;t get my license in Tuskegee, at least Chicago&#8217;s closer than Paris.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene shrugs over her armful of dirty shirts. &#8220;If you say so.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I do.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Just remembering my first time in a plane, in my daddy&#8217;s old Curtiss JN-4 &#8220;Jenny,&#8221; I get goose bumps. Nothing else on God&#8217;s green earth does that to me. Of course it&#8217;s worth it.</div><div class="tx">Last year, just before I turned seventeen, Mama&#8217;s daddy, Grandy, convinced her to let me go to Tuskegee to take my pilot&#8217;s test. I&#8217;d taken over Daddy&#8217;s side business of dusting crops, but I needed my license. Daddy would have taken me, had he lived. I&#8217;d already flown over forty hours with him, and I had passed the written exam by mail just before he died. All I needed to do was go up in a real plane with a certified instructor. Mama kept Daddy&#8217;s promise by letting me go.</div><div class="tx">Grandy and I showed up real early at the airfield. I was so excited I thought I&#8217;d have to run to the restroom and pee every five minutes. Grandy was as calm as could be, though, and that helped me a lot. The instructor, a Mr. Anderson, showed up, and he was a white man, with blue eyes and a firm jawline. I&#8217;d heard he had passed other colored pilots at the base, and I thought he looked tough, but fair.</div><div class="tx">Well, I said a little prayer asking Daddy for help, and I took that instructor up in the test plane. It was a Jenny, like Daddy had taught me on, easy as slipping into an old sweater. We did rolls, and loops, and landings, and I could hardly stop smiling because I knew I&#8217;d done good.</div><div class="tx">But when we climbed out of that plane, Mr. Anderson looked at me and said, &#8220;You can fly, no doubt about it. But no woman&#8217;s gonna get a license out of me. Go home, Miss Jones. You&#8217;ve failed.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I stood there, staring at his strong jawline and his blue eyes, and if looks could set a fire, he&#8217;d have been a three-alarm blaze by the time I was done. Grandy, who&#8217;s seen more than his share of wrongness, just took my arm and said, &#8220;S&#8217;all right, honey. We&#8217;ve got better places to go.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">That better place is Chicago, the Coffey School of Aeronautics. Owned and run by colored people, like me. Teaching men and women alike. No matter how long it takes me, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working toward.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Stop daydreaming, Ida,&#8221; Jolene says, disappearing into the washing room. &#8220;Hurry down here so we can talk.&#8221; Her voice carries from the back of the house. I finish scrubbing the banister, still trying to figure out how to get to Chicago without letting Mama catch on. She doesn&#8217;t like the idea of me flying. She only lets me dust crops because it pays a little and Grandy comes with me. Daddy is the only person who could convince her that I&#8217;d be okay by myself. But since he&#8217;s gone, I&#8217;m on my own. As far as Mama is concerned, going to the big city by myself is crazy enough. She&#8217;d call me a damn fool if she knew it was because I wanted to fly.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Finally,&#8221; Jolene says as I round the corner to the washing room. &#8220;Grab a tub&#8212;this is old-fashioned dirt in these socks. It&#8217;ll take a washboard to clean them.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She pours boiling water from a kettle into the washer and runs those socks through about a hundred times each. Mr. Wilson fancies himself a golfer, but you&#8217;d think he was a gopher with all the dirt he brings home with him from the  course. The socks are a hopeless cause. Still, I put them in a galvanized tub with bleach to get them white and bluing to get them even whiter. Laundry is my least favorite part of housekeeping. The smell of the soap and chemicals stays in your skin for a week. Sometimes, on a hot day, I feel like I sweat bleach.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now, about Chicago,&#8221; Jolene says, sounding just like her mother. Miss Tara is a math teacher, and whenever she puts herself to any sort of problem, math or otherwise, you just know she&#8217;ll solve it. Jolene isn&#8217;t as reliable as her mama, but it is comforting to have her on my side, just the same.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Here&#8217;s what to do. Tell your ma that you&#8217;re visiting my mama&#8217;s sister in Natchez, with me. I&#8217;ll even go see my old aunt to keep your story straight.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You make it sound like a sacrifice,&#8221; I say, &#8220;when everybody knows your aunt lives across the river from the city. And that she falls asleep early every single night, Miss I&#8217;ll Be Back Before She Knows I&#8217;m Gone.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Why should I suffer for you?&#8221; Jolene raises an eyebrow and laughs. &#8220;Besides, we can&#8217;t all fly airplanes. Some of us have got to keep both feet on the ground. New Orleans is a good place to do just that.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;On the ground, Jolene? On the dance floor of a jazz club is more like it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene grins, the gap showing in her smile. She pats her Marcel curls beneath the gray scarf that is part of our cleaning uniform. &#8220;Don&#8217;t I know it, don&#8217;t I know it.&#8221; Jolene has a fantasy of leaving Slidell to sing in a New Orleans nightclub. Trouble is, she has no voice for it. So she spends her days in the city with me, washing clothes and cleaning houses.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Jolene, you are nothing but trouble.&#8221; I reach over her head  and turn on the radio we have stashed on the laundry room shelf. There&#8217;s a ball game on, so I fiddle with the knobs.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Put some music on. <i>Sammy Kaye&#8217;s Sunday Serenade</i> should be on.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You&#8217;ve already got the record going, and every radio station&#8217;s starting up with Christmas carols. Besides, I just want to hear the news.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I twist the dial until the news comes in good and strong. The news is much the same as it was last night. The Germans and Russians are fighting in subzero temperatures, and Japan&#8217;s moving troops in the Far East despite our peace talks. Jolene sighs and goes back to scrubbing the laundry. I turn the volume down so we can talk over the news and the phonograph playing upstairs.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Did you know the Russians let their women fly military planes?&#8221; I say. &#8220;In England, too. Ferrying planes for the air force. Isn&#8217;t that a kick?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Loony&#8217;s more like it. What girl in her right mind wants to be flying around in a war zone?&#8221; Jolene rolls her eyes at me and my face goes hot. &#8220;Baby, you&#8217;re not only fly crazy, you&#8217;re war crazy, too. That&#8217;s a bad combination.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I cut off the radio to keep the peace, and Jolene starts singing along with the record. It&#8217;s nearly four o&#8217;clock by the time we&#8217;re finished with the Wilsons&#8217;. We yank off our head scarves and shake out our hair on the back steps of the house. We button up our sweaters against the slight December chill. Jolene pulls her copy of the house key from her pocket and locks the place up tight.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I sure hope Mr. Wilson is grateful for the Sunday cleaning,&#8221; Jolene says, dropping the key into her bag. &#8220;I need a new pair of stockings.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Why do you waste your money, Jolene? Silk is for show-girls and debutantes.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And young ladies who hope to catch a man someday. You&#8217;d do well to get yourself a pair, or you&#8217;ll end up an old maid.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Takes one to know one.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Speak for yourself,&#8221; she says. I turn to see her smiling her prettiest little smile at some city road worker across the street. The boy can&#8217;t be much older than we are, and he sure looks all right in his overalls and cap. It takes me a minute to recognize him as Danny Taylor from our elementary school.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Danny Taylor, is that you?&#8221; I call out.</div><div class="tx">Jolene frowns and drops the able-Grable sexy act. &#8220;Aw, heck, Dan. What you doing, looking all grown up like that?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We wait for a break in the traffic and jog across the cobblestones. Poydras Street is a leafy place, sheltered by live oaks with crepe myrtle trees growing in between. Danny Taylor smiles at us when we get closer. He&#8217;s got a nice smile, broad with teeth as white as milk in a strong brown face.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida Mae Jones, I thought you was a white woman walking over there with that fine light skin and pretty brown hair.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My hand goes instantly to my curls, loose and smooth, like my daddy&#8217;s. The kind of curls Jolene calls &#8220;good hair.&#8221; Not tight and hard to handle, like hers.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What about my hair?&#8221; Jolene asks, eyebrows arched. &#8220;And my fine <i>brown</i> skin?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Danny grins, unaware he&#8217;s offended her or me, for that matter. I&#8217;m shy of my fair looks, and Jolene&#8217;s more than a little jealous. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s how I knew she wasn&#8217;t white. You&#8217;re dressed the same, and Jolene, you&#8217;re as black as a good cup of coffee.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Best coffee you&#8217;ll never have,&#8221; she says, and turns her nose up in the air.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, it was good to see you, Danny,&#8221; I say, anxious to leave.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What&#8217;s your rush? I haven&#8217;t seen either of you two since the eighth grade.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, some of us stuck around and graduated,&#8221; Jolene snaps. She&#8217;s decided not to like Danny Taylor.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, some of us had to work,&#8221; Danny says right back. At school, I had known Danny mostly through my brother. I remember when Thomas came home one day and told us his friend had to quit school to help his family pay the bills. Jolene knows it, too.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;How&#8217;s your mama?&#8221; I ask.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Fine, fine. Doctor says she has a sugar problem, but she&#8217;s doing all right.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Glad to hear it,&#8221; I say.</div><div class="tx">Jolene&#8217;s folded up her arms now. She looks at me and frowns.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, Danny, like I said, it was nice seeing you, but we&#8217;ve got to get the trolley and all before the buses shut down. Sundays are always awful tight.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Say hi to your brother for me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I will.&#8221; Jolene is dragging me away now. I stumble on the pavement, catch myself, and wave goodbye.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You just keep waving goodbye to Joe Corn over there,&#8221; she says in a clipped voice. &#8220;Girl, you can do better than smiling up in his face like that.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Jolene, I was being polite. You could take a lesson or two. What&#8217;s wrong with you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene stops in her tracks and screws up her face so tight,  I think she&#8217;s going to cry. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she says unhappily. &#8220;It&#8217;s just . . . am I pretty at all? He didn&#8217;t even look at me. Just Little Miss Pretty Hair and Her Creamy White Skin. I love you, Ida, but he just made me so mad.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Me, too.&#8221; I put an arm around her. We stand there, half hugging, with nothing left to say. Daddy once told me color didn&#8217;t matter as much to folks up north. Light-skinned like me and him or dark like Mama and Jolene, up there he said they&#8217;d treat all colored folks the same, like we were all white. I&#8217;d sure like to see that, &#8217;cause down here, color seems to be the only place it&#8217;s at.</div><div class="tx">The trolley down St. Charles Avenue is empty of colored folks. Jolene and I sit to the back and watch the big houses roll by. St. Charles Avenue is the prettiest place on earth, a green tunnel of live oak trees arching across two paved roads, the trolley running down the middle on its cables. Only the richest, whitest folks live up here. We trundle past Audubon Park and the university, same as always, but inside this trolley car something is different. Jolene nudges me with her foot.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s like a funeral in here,&#8221; she says. It&#8217;s true. Usually, the trolley is buzzing with laughter, chatter, and just plain noise. But now, it&#8217;s like a storm is coming. The few people on board are deadly quiet.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sooner we get home, the better,&#8221; I tell her. The trip up Carrollton Avenue is just as slow. At the last stop, we hop off and run across the wide street to catch the bus back to Slidell.</div><div class="tx">There&#8217;s more folks sitting in the back of the bus. One of them, a dignified-looking, coffee-colored gentleman in a neatly pressed suit, has a newspaper.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Excuse me, sir. What&#8217;s the news?&#8221; I ask him.</div><div class="tx">He looks up at me, startled, and starts to stand. There are plenty of seats, though. Jolene has saved me one.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he says, rising.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, no, no. I just noticed you had the paper. Does it say what&#8217;s going on? Everyone seems so . . .&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He looks at me a moment longer and settles back into his seat, seeing that I&#8217;m colored, too.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ah, sorry, baby girl. You haven&#8217;t heard? We&#8217;ve been attacked by the Japanese.&#8221;</div></body></html>';

What&#8217;s happened?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Come inside, it&#8217;s on the radio.

Mama&#8217;s daddy, Grandy, is at the table now, and his big head with its close-cropped white hair is bowed over his clasped farmer&#8217;s hands, like he&#8217;s praying. My little brother, Abel, is sitting at the table like it was Sunday school, his seven-year-old face solemn and unsure. He watches me with round eyes as I sit next to him. Mama pulls up a fourth chair. Music is playing, just like any other day. We sit there, hands clasped like Grandy&#8217;s, until a news bulletin breaks in.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;This is an NBC news bulletin. The Japanese have bombed our naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, this morning. In an unexpected attack, a squadron of Japanese planes came out of the sky, dropping bombs on the naval base and the island of Oahu. The president is expected to speak tomorrow morning. This can only be taken as an act of war. We now return to our regularly scheduled program.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Grandy sighs, long and low, and raises his head. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be wanting Thomas,&#8221; he says.</div><div class="tx">I stare at him. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama shakes her head. &#8220;But there are so many others who will <i>want</i> to go. He&#8217;s not meant to be a soldier. He&#8217;s going to be a surgeon. Will they really . . .&#8221; She trails off, tears settling in the worry lines around her eyes.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Mama,&#8221; I say quickly. &#8220;Thomas knows we need him here. Besides, Hawaii is a long way off from Louisiana. Europe is, too. They can&#8217;t touch us here.&#8221; I stand up and put my arms around her. She holds on to me tight, the way I used to hold on to her when I was little. It scares me, but it&#8217;s all right. We&#8217;ll be okay.</div><div class="tx">Grandy cuts off the radio. &#8220;President don&#8217;t speak until tomorrow.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Supper&#8217;s almost ready,&#8221; Mama says, pulling away from me. She straightens her apron, wipes her eyes on a corner, and smiles at me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida Mae Jones, what have you done to your hair?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I feel the thick wave of it and realize I forgot to comb it out after taking my head scarf off. &#8220;Oh, we were cleaning. I&#8217;ll brush it. Does it look bad?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Girl, you&#8217;d leave your head in the dishwater, if you weren&#8217;t paying attention,&#8221; Mama says. She&#8217;s okay now. &#8220;Good thing you got your daddy&#8217;s hair, else you&#8217;d be looking like a feather bed. Now go wash up and help me finish the potatoes. You&#8217;ve got to have an appetite after all the running you must&#8217;ve done to get home today.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; I say. And we move about the house like we have a thousand times before, Grandy in the living room shuffling cards to play Old Maid with Abel, Mama and I side by side at the kitchen sink. Sailors are dying in Hawaii, women are flying overseas. But everything is the same for the Joneses of Slidell, Louisiana.</div><div class="tx">That night, after dinner, I go into the barn and pull the cover off of my father&#8217;s airplane. Even in the dark, she&#8217;s beautiful, with her stacked yellow wings, blue-and-white-striped tail, and red propeller. She shines like new. You take care of a plane, Daddy used to say, and it will take care of you. It&#8217;s dark in the barn, but I know the Jenny like the back of my hand. I climb into her open cockpit and settle myself inside. The leather seat cups my back and I rest my head, looking at the rafters up above. The war is here, flown in by Japanese fighter planes. I close my eyes and wonder if it will ever be safe for me to fly again.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Monday morning dawns clear and blue. It was probably just as blue over Hawaii when the Japanese bombs started to fall. Mama keeps us busy while we wait for my big brother to come home. Thomas is a medical student at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. But he&#8217;s taking a leave of absence after what happened yesterday. At a time like this, everyone should be home. I clear away the breakfast dishes, wash them, dry them, put them in the cupboard, and try not to think.</div><div class="tx">Grandy disappears into the barn and comes back with a piece from his tractor. He turns on the radio, then sits at the kitchen table and begins to dismantle the greasy bits of metal over a piece of newspaper. Abel sits on the living room floor with one of the barn cats and some of Mama&#8217;s yarn. Mama never lets the cats inside. But today, she doesn&#8217;t seem to mind.  She&#8217;s knitting a scarf for Thomas. &#8220;Christmas is almost here,&#8221; she says, and I can hear the choke in her voice. All of us fiddle with our hands and listen to the president speak.</div><div class="tx">I think of those warplanes, flying over American houses, American families. I listen to the sky over our kitchen and pray. On the radio, Mr. Roosevelt&#8217;s speech ends. A thousand miles away in Washington, the Congress erupts in applause. For me, there is nothing to clap for.</div><div class="tx">Thomas reaches the house, dusty and tired. He runs up the stairs and throws the door open as the radio ovation fades. Yesterday, we were a nation at peace. And now we are at war.</div><div class="tx">Thomas sweeps Mama into a hug.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, baby, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re home,&#8221; Mama says, holding him tight. She wrings her hands as my big brother takes off his jacket and hangs up his hat on one of the hooks by the door. &#8220;How could all of this have happened on a Sunday?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem right,&#8221; Thomas agrees. We have no answers. None at all.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Right or wrong, we&#8217;ll make it through,&#8221; Grandy says. &#8220;Good to see you, son.&#8221; He and Thomas grip hands. Seeing the two of them together makes me wish my daddy was here.</div><div class="tx">Thomas clears his throat. &#8220;I made a decision on my way over here. I&#8217;m enlisting.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The room gets so quiet I can hear the clock ticking on the mantel. I look from Mama to Grandy to Thomas. Mama is the first to speak.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You&#8217;ll eat lunch first.&#8221; Her face is gray, but she keeps her dignity. She pats Thomas on the shoulder, tells Abel to get rid of that cat, and goes into the kitchen, humming.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;How you doing, Clayfoot?&#8221; Thomas grins at me. His smile is contagious. I hug my big brother.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be stupid, Tommy,&#8221; I tell him. &#8220;You can&#8217;t enlist. We need you here.&#8221; But he doesn&#8217;t listen.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It won&#8217;t be just the Japs,&#8221; he says into my hair. &#8220;The Nazis&#8217;ll be next. And the Negro doesn&#8217;t stand a chance in a world run by them.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I nod as though I understand, but I don&#8217;t. Like those women flying over Europe, it seems like a picture show, far away and unreal. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost Christmas, Tommy. There&#8217;s a whole ocean between here and the Nazis. Let the ocean do its job.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Thomas pulls back, and he&#8217;s frowning now. My brother&#8217;s gotten taller and more handsome since he&#8217;s been at school. He looks more like Daddy every time I see him. The same strong hands, the same warm eyes. Only the curlier hair and pale coffee skin are different.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;The ocean didn&#8217;t stop the Japanese,&#8221; he says.</div><div class="tx">My heart sinks into my stomach. &#8220;Tommy, please.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Clayfoot.&#8221; He uses the pet name again. &#8220;You sure are just a kid after all. Which makes it harder for me to ask what I need to, but I&#8217;ll ask it, anyway. I&#8217;m going to join up in this war, a lot of young men are, and I&#8217;ll be leaving you all. Not like for school in Nashville, but far, far away. And Abel is too young to do this for me, and Grandy is too old. So it falls to you, Ida Mae.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My heart pounds; he is serious, serious if he&#8217;s calling me by my given name.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Take care of Mama, Ida. Take care of Grandy, of Abel, of yourself, too. There are important things in this world that a man&#8217;s got to do. But we do it for our families. I&#8217;ll fight for our country, to keep you all safe. You just make sure everyone&#8217;s still here when I get back.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I want to close my eyes. I don&#8217;t want to see Thomas standing there, looking so serious, as serious as he did kneeling by that tractor the day Daddy died. I never wanted to see that look on his face again, but it&#8217;s there. I grab his hand and try to smile.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You&#8217;re too serious sometimes,&#8221; I want to say. But I can&#8217;t. Instead, I end up giving him another hug.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I promise. We&#8217;ll be all right. As long as you are, too.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He laughs then and shakes my hand very formally. &#8220;It&#8217;s a deal.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Neither one of us knows we&#8217;ve made promises we can&#8217;t keep.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">It was a hot day in August when Daddy died. I was sixteen years old. Thomas was nineteen. He and Daddy were working the east field, turning the old husks into the soil, when something went wrong. The tractor flipped over on top of Daddy, and Thomas ran three whole miles to get help. Mama and I came racing out of the house as Thomas flew past us, pointing and hollering, running to get more men to lift the tractor.</div><div class="tx">He was too late, but not too late to hear Daddy, with his last breath, talking to Mama and me. She was holding his hand like she could keep his soul from leaving his body, but he just squeezed it back and smiled. &#8220;Stella, look at that boy run,&#8221; he said, seeing Thomas come up all sweaty and scared, ten men and the doctor behind him, ready to pull that tractor off of Daddy. &#8220;Did you see that?&#8221; Daddy said. &#8220;Look at old Thomas. He sure can fly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Thomas flew, all right; he flew right out of Slidell. He was  never going to be a dirt farmer, he said, set to die in the tracks of his plow. He got as far as Meharry, where he is learning to be a doctor so he will never have to run three miles for one again.</div><div class="tx">And now my big brother&#8217;s running all the way to the war.</div><div class="tx">After dinner, Grandy is the first one to speak.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now, be sure you get posted as an officer,&#8221; he tells Thomas, jabbing the table with a blunt finger. Grandy fought in the trenches in the Great War. &#8220;That&#8217;ll keep you out of the worst of it, even in a Negro unit.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; Thomas nods. Grandy&#8217;s got everyone&#8217;s attention.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t be too hard,&#8221; Grandy says. &#8220;A half-schooled doctor is better than no doctor at all. That should get you a commission. You&#8217;ll be all right, as long as you&#8217;re not in the trenches. A colored man in the trenches is worse than dead.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama goes real quiet. She was two years younger than me when Grandy went off to France. She remembers it well enough, I know, but she never talks about it. Thomas puts his hand over hers on the table. I don&#8217;t know what to say to anybody, so I go get Abel and bring him upstairs for bed.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida, what&#8217;s gonna happen to Thomas?&#8221; Abel asks me when I tuck him in.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Nothing, Abel. Nothing.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Abel fixes me with those sharp brown eyes of his and frowns. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell stories, Ida. I been to the picture shows. I seen the war reels. I know what it means when he says he&#8217;s signing up.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I sit still and look at my little brother. Abel is just a kid. He shouldn&#8217;t know this stuff. &#8220;Yeah, well, Tommy is pretty smart,  don&#8217;t you think? Training to be a doctor and all. I think he&#8217;ll be helping other soldiers stay strong and not in any real danger himself.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I guess.&#8221; Abel lies back beneath the quilted coverlet Mama made for him from Daddy&#8217;s old sweaters. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going anywhere, are you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now, where am I supposed to go?&#8221; I ask him, laughing. But in the pit of my stomach, I realize I did have someplace to go. Chicago. Chicago, to prove I can fly.</div><div class="tx">My heart sinks when I didn&#8217;t think it could get any lower. The dreams of one little colored girl don&#8217;t matter to a world at war. But they matter to me. I swallow my sorrow and kiss Abel on the forehead.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Go to bed, silly. And stop asking fool questions.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Good night, Ida Mae.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Good night, Abel James.&#8221; I wrinkle my nose and he giggles.</div><div class="tx">I cut off the light as I&#8217;m leaving, and I hear Abel singing in his seven-year-old voice, real soft, so he thinks I can&#8217;t hear him. &#8220;Shoo, fly, don&#8217;t bother me. Shoo, fly, don&#8217;t bother me. Shoo, fly, don&#8217;t bother me. For I belong to somebody . . .&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I smile in the dark at the top of the stairway. Thomas taught me that song. Used to sing it to me in that same reedy little boy voice whenever something was bothering me or making me sad.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Troubles are like flies, Ida,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;You just have to brush them away.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Shoo, fly, don&#8216;t bother me,&#8221; I repeat softly in the dark at the top of the stairs, struggling to keep the loss I feel at bay. Chicago will happen someday, maybe after this war. &#8220;Shoo,  fly, don&#8217;t bother me. Shoo, fly, don&#8217;t bother me. For I belong to somebody. I feel, I feel, I feel like a morning star; I feel, I feel, I feel like a morning star. Shoo, fly, don&#8217;t bother me. Shoo, fly, don&#8217;t bother me. Shoo, fly, don&#8217;t bother me. For I belong to somebody.&#8221;</div></body></html>';

Thomas has been gone for more than a year and a half, and his letters are few and far between. It&#8217;s for the best, I know. Mama couldn&#8217;t read more of the kind of news he&#8217;d been sending. We&#8217;d barely started fighting Japan when Germany and Italy jumped on top of us, too. The whole world&#8217;s gone to war.</div><div class="tx">Thomas is a field medic for the colored infantry in the South Pacific, where we&#8217;re fighting the Japanese. I don&#8217;t know how he gets along. He survived the Battle of Midway just months after enlisting, and we thanked our lucky stars. But our Thomas is still on the other side of the world, where boys are dying like flies in the August heat. This war looks like it&#8217;s here to stay.</div><div class="tx">There&#8217;s more work now that the war effort is on. In addition to the Wilsons, Jolene and I are cleaning for the LaRoches and the Thibodeaux family on Camp Street. The money&#8217;s good, but I&#8217;m not any closer to Chicago. Daddy&#8217;s Jenny is up on blocks in the barn for the time being. Airplanes and fuel are reserved for the war effort, not for colored girls who dust crops without their licenses. There&#8217;s not much else for me to do these days except for clean houses and keep my promise to Thomas.</div><div class="tx">For two whole days, Jolene and I do nothing but collect silk stockings from all the women we work for and turn them in to the army parachute program. Jolene looked like to die  when she had to give up her sackful, but it&#8217;s for a good cause, so she&#8217;s being stoic about it.</div><div class="tx">Seems there&#8217;s a different way to help every day. Mama&#8217;s been saving up all her bacon grease because the military says they can use it to make ammunition and medicine. I don&#8217;t know how bacon fat can kill a Nazi unless you feed it to him by the bucketful, but they&#8217;ve got some use for it, anyway. Mama likes to think Thomas has helped some wounded soldiers with the grease she donates at the butcher shop. Even Grandy has gotten into the effort, turning in the spare tires from our tractor. Rubber was one of the first things to be rationed, and any little bit that&#8217;s nonessential goes into the war machine.</div><div class="tx">With everything so rare these days, the government has issued ration books through the elementary school. Mama and I got ours from Abel&#8217;s teacher, Mrs. Marvin. She checked our names off her list and gave us four little books of twenty-eight stamps each, one book for everybody in our family. Every time we buy a rationed item, the cashier rips out a stamp to show we&#8217;ve used up our share. Just before Christmas, they added coffee to the ration list.</div><div class="tx">Today, Mrs. Wilson gives me and Jolene her ration book to get her some sugar. &#8220;I thought about what you said, Ida. I&#8217;d better get it now before the well&#8217;s run dry.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I was actually only repeating what Mama had said to me the week before. Rationing&#8217;s got her remembering what she learned in the Depression: &#8220;Stock up, Ida Mae, or you&#8217;ll be like that grasshopper come wintertime.&#8221; I nod at Mrs. Wilson and smile. &#8220;That&#8217;s right, Mrs. Wilson. It&#8217;ll keep in the cupboard real nice, anyway.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You girls run along and let me know if you see anything else that might be getting low.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The day is so humid, our dresses stick to our skin the minute we step outside. Jolene and I walk the three blocks to the corner grocery store, swinging our shopping bags over our shoulders.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Why the long face, Miss Jones?&#8221; Jolene asks me in a joking voice.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Nothing, I guess. We got another letter from Thomas today.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene shakes her head. &#8220;I wish I had some fine young Negro writing letters home to me,&#8221; she says with a cluck of her tongue. I roll my eyes.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Jolene, we&#8217;re talking about my <i>brother</i> here,&#8221; I remind her.</div><div class="tx">She gives me a look, raising her eyebrow. &#8220;I know. He&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, no! You are something else!&#8221; I exclaim.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I know that, too,&#8221; Jolene replies, shaking her hips. &#8220;You can put <i>that</i> in your next letter to him for me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I laugh in spite of myself. &#8220;You&#8217;re terrible.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene smiles. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell him that part. Besides, you&#8217;re smiling again, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yeah.&#8221; I sigh. Just pointing it out makes my smile fade. &#8220;In his letter, Thomas said things are bad out there. Not in so many words, but I can tell.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s war,&#8221; Jolene says, as if she&#8217;s lived through more than one. But I know she&#8217;s right.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Still, it seems silly. Thomas has men dying on his stretchers every day, and we sit here hoarding sugar and saving rubber, like that&#8217;s gonna make a difference.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene shrugs. &#8220;What else can we do? We don&#8217;t fight the wars. And I wouldn&#8217;t want to, anyway.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Nobody wants to, Jolene. But don&#8217;t you think we could be doing something more? There are nurses overseas. And there&#8217;s the Women&#8217;s Army Corps. Those women must be doing something to help out if the army&#8217;s using them.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene swings her bag onto her hip and fixes me with a look. &#8220;Now, I <i>know</i> you&#8217;re not thinking of joining the WACs. You want to be a secretary, you can do that right here at home.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;They do more than that,&#8221; I protest. &#8220;Like radio operators and such.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene shakes her head. &#8220;Ida, those women are either man hungry or funny in the head. No, ma&#8217;am, we are exactly where we belong.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;On the corner of St. Charles and Camp Street, loading up on sugar? Jolene Dupree, you sure do aim low.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene harrumphs and keeps walking. &#8220;Call it what you will, but I&#8217;ll be alive and looking good when those boys come home again. Remind them of what they&#8217;ve been fighting for.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We are in front of the grocery store now, but Jolene&#8217;s not done reprimanding me. We step to the side of the doorway to let an old lady pass us by. Jolene looks up at me and I notice, for the first time, sorrow in her face. &#8220;Men do the fighting, Ida Mae. Women take care of the home. You can be proud of that. It&#8217;s enough. Too much, sometimes, but it&#8217;s more than enough.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We stare at each other in the afternoon light, the door to the market swinging open and shut as other women, clutching their ration books, go by.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m just worried about Thomas,&#8221; I say finally.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I know, sugar, but it doesn&#8217;t do much good. You remember that Danny Taylor from school?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Of course.&#8221; I nod. &#8220;He still doing roadwork for the city?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No. I heard he shipped off last month. Headed to France.&#8221; A shadow crosses Jolene&#8217;s face. &#8220;I think about the last time we saw him. I should have been nicer to him.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We stand together a little longer in the thick heat filtering through the leaves of live oak above us.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Missus is waiting,&#8221; Jolene finally says. We go into the store to stock up on sugar for the Wilsons&#8217; morning coffee.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">The sorrowful mood from the afternoon is still sitting on me when I get home. It&#8217;s too warm to cook inside the house. Mama and Grandy are keeping cool on the front porch. In the kitchen, I find the ham sandwich Mama has made for me from Sunday&#8217;s supper and eat it quietly with a glass of milk. The newspaper is lying on the table. I haven&#8217;t read the front pages in months. I don&#8217;t want to read any more about the war. Instead, I hunt for the recipes page and learn thrifty new ideas for using Spam and an apple pie recipe that doesn&#8217;t use apples.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Abel&#8217;s upstairs,&#8221; Mama calls to me from the front porch. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you see him to bed for me, Ida.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;All right, Mama.&#8221; I fold up the newspaper and clean up the dishes before trudging up the stairs. The air is warmer at the top of the landing, but the windows are all open, and the slightest breeze is pulling through the upper rooms of the house. Abel is sitting on his bed, already in his pajamas, playing with a wooden horse the size of a small kitten.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hi, Abel. Mama says it&#8217;s time for bed.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hey, Ida Mae.&#8221; Abel&#8217;s smile sparkles. He pulls his knees up to his chin and draws the covers up around him. &#8220;It&#8217;s too hot for a quilt, but it makes me sleep.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sleep makes you sleep,&#8221; I tell him, and sit on the edge of  his bed. &#8220;The quilt is just a good reminder. How was class today?&#8221; School starts early in Slidell so kids can be home to help with the spring and summer harvests.</div><div class="tx">Abel shrugs. &#8220;It was all right. It&#8217;s too hot for school, too. I got you something, though.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What is it?&#8221; I ask him, half afraid it&#8217;ll be some frog or worm he found in the fields. But Abel surprises me by reaching beneath his pillow and pulling out the front section of today&#8217;s newspaper.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Mrs. Marvin read it to us. On the third page. She said it was all part of what we can do for the war effort.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I turn up the lamp beside Abel&#8217;s bed and search for the article. My eyes widen when I see it. <i>Free a Man to Fight,</i> the headline says. <i>Mrs. Jackie Cochran, the cosmetics mogul and celebrated pilot, has joined forces with the United States Army to train women as ferrying pilots, freeing men to fight in the war effort overseas. The program will be called the Women Airforce Service Pilots, an offshoot of the Women&#8217;s Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron, begun by Nancy Love.</i></div><div class="tx">I squint at the fine print in the yellow glow of the lamp. I can&#8217;t believe a word I&#8217;ve just read. I read it again. And a third time. My heart starts to thump a little louder in my chest.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;They&#8217;re doing it, Ida,&#8221; Abel says excitedly. &#8220;Making women pilots, just like those Russian ladies you&#8217;re always talking about. Only ours get to fly planes, not brooms.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be,&#8221; I say, but my mind is a thousand miles away, at Sweetwater, Texas, where the training is taking place. Sweetwater must be nothing but wide-open sky. I take a deep, calming breath. Don&#8217;t get ahead of yourself, Ida Mae.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You could do it, I bet,&#8221; Abel says, yawning. I look at the clock on the dresser. It&#8217;s getting late.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You need to sleep, little man.&#8221; I kiss Abel on his smooth brown forehead and again on each cheek. &#8220;You&#8217;re something else,&#8221; I tell him. I kiss him again, until he starts to squirm. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; I whisper into the shell of his ear. &#8220;Good night!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I run down the stairs as fast as I can. On the front porch, I race by Mama and Grandy.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to Jolene&#8217;s, Mama,&#8221; I call out as I pass by. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back before ten.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ten?&#8221; I hear Mama say. &#8220;Ida Mae . . .&#8221; But I don&#8217;t hear any more. I&#8217;ve got to tell Jolene about this. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been looking for. It&#8217;s a sign from heaven above.</div><div class="tx">I don&#8217;t go to Jolene&#8217;s, though. I&#8217;m halfway through the strawberries when I realize she won&#8217;t even be awake by the time I get there. Instead, I head out into the fields where my daddy used to work so hard and lie down between the rows of sweet green leaves. I look up at the sky, the same sky my daddy loved.</div><div class="tx">Daddy had gotten it into his head one day back in 1934 that a crop duster plane was the way to go for farmers. It was the future. Sure, they&#8217;d only been around a few years, they were dangerous, and, quite frankly, only a handful of colored people knew how to fly. Yes, there was Bessie Coleman, she was one of the first, and a few people up north, but in Slidell, Louisiana, heck, in all of the South, not a single colored man or woman could fly.</div><div class="tx">So, Daddy went north. I was only eleven years old, Thomas was fourteen, and Abel was still a bump in Mama&#8217;s belly. Mama was mad that Daddy was leaving her on some fool&#8217;s errand, as she put it. That&#8217;s the year Grandy came to live with us. He looked after us, and the farm, while Daddy was away.  Even with her own daddy there, Mama was lonely. Airplanes were dangerous and she was scared. She dressed in black the whole time he was gone, practicing to be a widow, she said. But Daddy had his ideas and wouldn&#8217;t let them go. He took the train up to Chicago and enrolled in the aeronautics school, a new flying school set up by two colored men who were also licensed engineers. Daddy worked his tail off, he told us in his letters. At the end of five hundred hours of hard work, he was licensed to fly.</div><div class="tx">Daddy came back in a whirl of dust and wind with a trailer carrying his &#8220;big surprise.&#8221; I remember that day like yesterday. Daddy was waving his hat like a circus ringmaster, looking tall and handsome. Mama was big as a watermelon with Abel and Thomas was scowling. He was still mad at Daddy for making Mama unhappy. I was so excited I shifted from foot to foot in my gingham dress. It was, Daddy told us with a wink, a solemn occasion.</div><div class="tx">Once we were all gathered around, he whipped off the tarp and&#8212;ta da! There she stood, in all her glory&#8212;Daddy&#8217;s very own plane. Her name was Jenny, actually a Curtiss JN-4. It was the same kind of plane Bessie Coleman had flown in, Daddy told us proudly. It was also the plane she was flying in when it malfunctioned and she died, Mama added.</div><div class="tx">Daddy didn&#8217;t mind, though; he was like a sunny day that could not be dimmed by clouds. After much fanfare and a thorough once-over of all of the moving parts, he took us up in that Jenny one by one. Grandy went up first, serious-faced and silent. When he landed, he declared that it would be a good way to spray the crops rather than have to worry away crickets and cicadas by hand. Thomas came back down smiling, and even Mama went up, though she swore that Abel was born early because of the fright that flying gave her.</div><div class="tx">Me, I went up last. And I never wanted to come down again. First the driveway, then the farm, then all the fields of cotton and alfalfa and all of Slidell dropped away until it looked like the quilt on my bed, big patches of green and brown, stained with shiny swampland here and there. For the first time in my eleven years, I felt like a giant, like I was tall as the sky.</div><div class="tx">So, whenever Daddy was willing, I flew with him. A few of the farmers in the area saw Daddy flying and, when they weren&#8217;t asking for rides, they paid him to treat their crops, too. It was at my daddy&#8217;s knee that I first learned to fly, naturally. As I got older, I read his school manuals and took the same tests he did, and I was good. He told me so. Good enough to get my own license and be a genuine pilot. After he died, I kept up the crop-dusting work. I felt close to Daddy every time I flew.</div><div class="tx">The war put an end to my flying days.</div><div class="tx">Until today.</div><div class="tx">The stars twinkle down like giant fireflies, and the fireflies in the field hover above me like tiny stars. Abel&#8217;s newspaper story is still in my hands, the ink staining my fingertips. I take a deep breath and smile.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Daddy, I&#8217;m gonna be a pilot in the U.S. Army,&#8221; I whisper. &#8221;Your little girl is gonna fly again. She is gonna fly.&#8221;</div></body></html>';

Her words are like a club coming down on my head. We are alone at the LaRoche house, washing windows for a big war fund-raising party they are giving. It&#8217;s a chance for the rich folks around here to feel useful. I have Abel&#8217;s newspaper article inside my apron pocket, keeping it close to me the way some people keep rosaries. But Jolene is a cold cup of water on my excitement.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t say that,&#8221; I protest.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t have to,&#8221; she explains. &#8220;Just say &#8216;Sweetwater, Texas,&#8217; and I know it&#8217;s whites only. Texas is as Jim Crow as it gets. Come to think of it, all you really needed to do was say &#8216;army,&#8217; and I could have told you how it would go. Sorry, Ida Mae. It&#8217;s a pretty little dream, but it&#8217;s only that.&#8221; Jolene sighs dramatically. &#8220;You should&#8217;ve just become a nurse.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; I say. She&#8217;s right, of course. Thomas is only allowed to treat other coloreds in the army. In fact, it&#8217;s like Uncle Sam runs two armies at once&#8212;one all white and the other colored. Grandy says that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s always been. They&#8217;ve finally decided to let women fly military planes. I don&#8217;t know why I thought that meant colored women, too.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Do you ever wish you were white, Jolene?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene raises an eyebrow and cuts me a sharp look. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t enough wishes in the world to make me white,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Besides, the darker the berry, the sweeter the juice.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I have to smile. &#8220;All right, Miss Juicy, but you know what  I mean. Most days it doesn&#8217;t matter. You go to work, you go home, you&#8217;ve got a family and the sun&#8217;s still shining . . . you&#8217;re happy. But then sometimes it&#8217;s like when I tried to get my license. If you&#8217;re colored, you get the short end of the stick. If you&#8217;re a woman, you get the short end of the stick. So what do we get for being colored <i>and</i> women?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene sighs. &#8220;Beat hard with both ends of a short stick.&#8221; She smiles wryly. &#8220;Well, honey, like I&#8217;ve said before, I&#8217;m Negro for life, but you could always pass.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My skin prickles at the thought. &#8220;You remember Stevia Johnson?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hoo, boy, do I,&#8221; Jolene exclaims. &#8220;Stevia was white as milk and had light eyes to boot. Her mama&#8217;s mama&#8217;s mama made sure they all married up the light ladder.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And she married a white man, too,&#8221; I add. Stevia was a year ahead of us in class. She got married almost right out of high school. When other girls were learning to be teachers or cleaning houses, Stevia married her boss at the department store she worked in. She&#8217;d been passing for years. It wasn&#8217;t unheard of, passing for a job or marrying white so your children could pass into a better life. Daddy&#8217;s family had done the same, until he married Mama, that is.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Stevia always was too uppity for me,&#8221; Jolene says.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Do you remember Janice?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene&#8217;s eyes narrow, and she gets real busy on a window streak.</div><div class="tx">Janice Johnson was not someone either of us were likely to forget. Two years ago, Stevia&#8217;s parents threw a graduation party for her, and I was invited because she knew Thomas. Jolene and I showed up just as happy as could be, excited to be invited to a senior class party. But Stevia&#8217;s cousin, Janice,  was standing at the door with a paper bag. Janice was as fair-skinned as Stevia. She could have gone blond if she wanted to without anyone batting an eye.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; she said when Jolene and I tried to walk through the door. She held up the paper bag to my cheek and said, &#8220;Go right in, honey,&#8221; in a sweet drawl that sounded more like a Georgia debutante than a New Orleans farm girl with a little bit of education. I went right on in and turned around to wait for Jolene.</div><div class="tx">Jolene never got past the front door.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Uh-uh, sugah, you&#8217;re black as molasses.&#8221; Janice held the paper bag up, pale as nutmeg against Jolene&#8217;s chocolaty skin. &#8220;You&#8217;re back-of-the-church black,&#8221; she said, referring to the way folks separate by skin tone in some churches. The blackest people sit in the last row, farthest away from God.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You can&#8217;t be serious!&#8221; I said. I&#8217;ll never forget the look on Jolene&#8217;s face, like she could&#8217;ve scratched Janice&#8217;s eyes out.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go, Jolene. We don&#8217;t need this.&#8221; I grabbed her hand.</div><div class="tx">She pulled free of me. &#8220;This is my business, Ida,&#8221; she said quietly, and stepped right up in that yellow girl&#8217;s face and said, &#8220;Janice Johnson, everybody knows you got your skin from the milkman and not your mama&#8217;s husband. He&#8217;s as black as me. At least I know who my daddy is!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Janice Johnson&#8217;s eyes went real wide, and she made a noise like a hiccup. &#8220;You&#8212;you little tart,&#8221; she stammered. People were turning to watch. Jolene smiled, liking the audience she had. She looked at Janice sweetly. Janice&#8217;s beautiful pale face had gone red and blotchy.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Tell it to your mama,&#8221; Jolene said, turned on her heel, swished her hips, and left. I had to hurry to keep up with her.  We laughed about it all the way down the block, but it had left a sour taste in my mouth. I never wanted to be like Janice Johnson or her cousin Stevia.</div><div class="tx">Now I smile in spite of myself. &#8220;Look at me. No license, no chance of getting one, and not even allowed to volunteer myself to fly. Thomas was right to call me Clayfoot.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene gives me a hug. &#8220;Cheer up, Clayfoot. Something&#8217;s gotta give.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yeah. Something.&#8221;</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Abel is the first to notice the Oriental girl in the photograph. &#8220;Is she colored?&#8221; he asks me. I&#8217;m folding clothes on my bed, still stiff from hanging on the clothesline. Abel thinks he&#8217;s helping me, but he&#8217;s really just sitting at my dressing table, fooling around with my combs and things. I turn to see what he&#8217;s pointing at. It&#8217;s the article about the WASP. After my little talk with Jolene, I cut the article out and clipped it to my mirror. It just gives me something to think about if I can&#8217;t join them. Abel is pointing to the article&#8217;s photograph, a picture of a group of the women in uniform.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;There aren&#8217;t any colored folk in the WASP,&#8221; I tell him, barely giving him a second glance. I&#8217;m too hurt to want to talk about it anymore.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, you&#8217;re not looking. Her. She&#8217;s colored or something. Her name is . . .&#8221; He leans in real close to read the caption of the photograph.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hazel . . . Ah Ying. Ying? What kind of name is that?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Ying. It&#8217;s like a bell going off in my head. &#8220;Ying? Are you sure?&#8221; I drop the blouse I&#8217;ve been fussing with and scramble over to the vanity.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;There,&#8221; Abel says proudly. It&#8217;s true, at the end of the row  of white faces, one is a little darker than the others. Hazel Ah Ying.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;She&#8217;s not a Negro, Abel. She&#8217;s Chinese.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Chinese? Aren&#8217;t we at war with the Chinese?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I kiss my brother on his curly head. &#8220;No, silly, we&#8217;re fighting the Japanese. Two different countries. You&#8217;ll learn about that in school.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I can&#8217;t stop smiling. They let a Chinese girl into the WASP program. A real Chinese girl. That means there&#8217;s hope for me, too.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You should sign up,&#8221; Abel says, like he&#8217;s reading my mind.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Should I?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yeah, why don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Why not? I think, but then the other reasons come knocking. &#8220;For one, I don&#8217;t have a license&#8212;&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Daddy does.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s not the same thing, Abel. I need my own pilot&#8217;s license to apply. All the flying and studying in the world won&#8217;t make up for that.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Abel frowns. &#8220;You could borrow Daddy&#8217;s license. Just like you borrow the truck sometimes, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s my turn to frown. Abel got my hopes up without meaning to, and now I&#8217;m feeling hurt all over again.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, Abel, you can&#8217;t. Now, don&#8217;t you have somewhere to be?&#8221; I snap. I don&#8217;t mean to, and I feel sorry the minute I say it, but I know I&#8217;ll be better off alone.</div><div class="tx">Fortunately, Abel is too caught up in his own thoughts to notice me. &#8220;See you later, Ida. I&#8217;m a help Mama make a pie.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He slides down off of my dressing chair and bounces out of the room.</div><div class="tx1">The next morning, I&#8217;m up early, not because I&#8217;m eager for work, but because I never really went to sleep. The article Abel gave me is clutched in my fist, the newsprint smeared across my fingers. I head up into the attic and find Daddy&#8217;s flying box.</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s a cash box, really, metal with a key still stuck in the lock. All of his flight manuals and paperwork are inside. I settle to the floorboards and put the box in my lap, running my fingers over the cool gray edges. This little box was like a treasure chest for me from the minute we landed in Daddy&#8217;s Jenny. It was a school and a library, too. I must&#8217;ve read everything in here at least a hundred times. And now, my fingers know exactly what they&#8217;re looking for.</div><div class="tx">In a small leather portfolio, worn as an old shoe, stuck in a place of honor, is my daddy&#8217;s pilot&#8217;s license. The license photo was one of the few pictures we had of him, so Mama took it out a long time ago and put it in the locket around her neck. It&#8217;s just a blank sheet of yellowish paper now, a little rough where the photo was peeled up. I rub my fingers across the page. Iden Mah&#233; Jones. He was named in English and French by his mother, and I was named after him.</div><div class="tx">Daddy&#8217;s license photo was taken with a Brownie camera, just like the one Mama used on vacation in Philadelphia when I was a baby.</div><div class="tx">I sit up there in the dust and the heat of the attic, Mama&#8217;s bedroom clock ticking away through the floorboards up to me, and I feel a hand on my shoulder. Daddy&#8217;s hand. He gives me just a little push, and though I don&#8217;t believe in ghosts, I believe my daddy is with me, and he&#8217;s telling me what to do next.</div><div class="tx">Iden Mah&#233;. Ida Mae. There&#8217;s a typewriter at the Dupree house, and I know Jolene will help me. I&#8217;m down those stairs just as soon as I can close the flying box. &#8220;Mama, where&#8217;s the camera?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What, girl? Don&#8217;t you come running through here like some man, banging your feet down those stairs.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sorry, Mama.&#8221; I round the corner to the kitchen, where she&#8217;s sitting at the table, balancing the books. &#8220;It&#8217;s just that . . . where&#8217;s the camera? The Brownie Daddy bought for your trip to the World&#8217;s Fair?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What you want with it?&#8221; Mama is way too good at reading when I&#8217;m up to something. I think fast.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I thought I could take some pictures of home to send to Thomas.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama&#8217;s face softens, and I feel terrible for lying. I promise myself that I will take some pictures for him.</div><div class="tx">Mama sniffs. &#8220;Baby girl, you do think of the sweetest things. All right, it&#8217;s in the closet in my room, on the top shelf. There&#8217;s some film in there, too, but it might be old. Take some change from the counter and buy some new film at the drugstore.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. And thanks, Mama.&#8221; I kiss her soft brown cheek. She&#8217;s the best a mother can be. When I run outside, I try not to slam the screen door, just for her.</div></body></html>';

I stand in front of a white sheet hanging on her mother&#8217;s clothesline, held taut at the bottom corners with clothespins clipped to strings on stakes, like a one-walled tent.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Do two more, just to be sure.&#8221; The sun isn&#8217;t too high in the sky anymore, so the shadows should look all right. I&#8217;ve got my hair done in a little wave, nothing too fancy. This is a serious photograph, after all. &#8220;Should I be smiling?&#8221; I ask. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m so nervous. It&#8217;s just a picture.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida Mae, if you don&#8217;t stop fidgeting, we&#8217;ll waste the whole roll of film on this nonsense.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sorry.&#8221; I&#8217;ve already used up half the roll on pictures of the farm for Thomas, for Mama&#8217;s sake. I don&#8217;t want to spend more money to buy more film just because I&#8217;m nervous.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;All right, then, one with a smile, one without.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The next day, on our way home from cleaning houses, I drop the roll off at Katz and Besthoff&#8217;s and wait for the prints to arrive in the mail. And then I write a letter to the director of the WASP program, at the address printed in the paper, and tell them I&#8217;d like to apply.</div><div class="tx">The pictures are the first to come back, in a thick cardboard envelope in the mail. I send half of them to Thomas, like I told Mama I would, then I go back to my room and try to figure out which picture will work the best on Daddy&#8217;s  license. You can see the grass in the corner of the first photograph, and Jolene&#8217;s shadow is covering half my face in the second. The third shot is good, but I&#8217;m smiling and I don&#8217;t know if I should be. Daddy&#8217;s not smiling in his picture, except for his eyes. The last photo will have to do. I look serious, but not too serious, and the sheet looks like a real photo backdrop.</div><div class="tx">I lick an eraser and use it to carefully remove the <i>n</i> and the  <i>h&#233;</i> in my father&#8217;s name and year of birth. It will be best to put the picture in and then run the whole thing through the Wilsons&#8217; typewriter to make the changes. That way, the photo might curl a bit and look less new. With a jar of paste borrowed from Abel&#8217;s school supplies, I carefully paste my picture into the booklet, over the place Daddy&#8217;s picture used to be.</div><div class="tx">It looks good there, side by side with the official pilot&#8217;s license. I&#8217;ll bring it to the Wilsons&#8217; day after tomorrow, when Jolene and I do our next cleaning. And then, well, we&#8217;ll just have to see.</div><div class="tx">The day I get the letter telling me to come to the Armory Building on Canal Street for an interview, I almost swallow my tongue to keep from letting Mama hear me squeal. Now my paste job on Daddy&#8217;s license gets put to the test and so do I. Jolene lets me borrow some of her best nylons&#8212;a rare treat since the war rationing began. I pack them in my cleaning bag, along with my best navy blue skirt suit, the one Mama bought me for high school graduation. It&#8217;s a fine Tuesday morning when we go to clean at the Wilsons&#8217;. But instead of cleaning, Jolene helps me get dressed for my interview. We put my hair back in a bun so it looks neat and out of the way. I pull on those nylons and put on a low pair of heels. I feel like an army girl already.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Girl, that suit&#8217;s all you got? You&#8217;d best borrow something from Mrs. Wilson&#8217;s closet. No point in looking podunk if you can help it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I look at my suit in the Wilsons&#8217; bedroom mirror. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong with this suit. Besides, Mrs. Wilson would fire us both if she caught us playing dress up in her closet.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Before the last word is out of my mouth, Jolene&#8217;s dropping a stole around my shoulders. Silver gray fox fur. It makes the blue of my suit look richer somehow.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now, Jolene, listen to me. I&#8217;m not wearing a fur in the middle of this heat.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Girl, you&#8217;d better hush and let Jolene do her magic.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I huff but bite my tongue. The fur does look good. The little hat Jolene puts on me next looks even better. Black felt with a blue grosgrain ribbon, a couple of dyed blue pheasant feathers, and a short blue birdcage veil. I look at my reflection in the mirror. I look like a movie star.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s fine, fine,&#8221; Jolene says approvingly.</div><div class="tx">I hesitate, but my reflection makes the decision for me. I really do look like a different person, not a housemaid in her graduation suit, but a lady with confidence.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I suppose . . . as long as I return it before she gets back into town.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying,&#8221; Jolene agrees with a self-satisfied smile. &#8220;Now remember, walk tall, say &#8216;yes&#8217; instead of &#8216;yeah,&#8217; and for heaven&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t talk to anybody you know. You&#8217;re white now. Act like it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I laugh, until I realize she&#8217;s not kidding. &#8220;Jolene,&#8221; I say, butterflies crowding my belly, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t gonna try to pass. If they took an Oriental girl, I think they&#8217;ll accept me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene scowls at me, and I can&#8217;t tell if it&#8217;s because she&#8217;s  angry at me or at what I&#8217;m doing. &#8220;Sugar, do you or don&#8217;t you want to fly?&#8221; she asks me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Of course I do.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better be safe over sorry. The more you sound like a country cousin, the less they&#8217;ll want you, Negro or not. So, stop saying &#8216;gonna&#8217; and get yourself downtown before you chicken out. And every time you think of turning back, remember this is your war effort. Do it for your brother. Just go.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She sends me off with a kiss on the cheek and not another word. I look at her in the doorway of the Wilsons&#8217; house and she doesn&#8217;t wave. Neither do I. I turn my back on Jolene and walk to the trolley car that will take me downtown. I&#8217;ll be able to do something more than collect bacon fat and iron scraps if they&#8217;ll let me fly. Light skin and good hair could put me in a military plane. Lord knows I don&#8217;t want to stand by the door waiting for Thomas to come home. I want to help him. And I guess if that means playing white, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do.</div><div class="tx">When my trolley comes, I have to remind myself to take a seat in the front. My skin gets all prickly just walking up the aisle. I start to feel hot when I sit down and fan myself with my gloved hand. No one says anything, though, and before I know it, I&#8217;m downtown, walking through a doorway where nobody stops me. The man operating the elevator is colored, but he doesn&#8217;t look twice at me, avoiding my eyes. That same shyness we all learn down here might work in my favor today.</div><div class="tx">On the third floor, a secretary takes my name and asks me to sit in a small wooden chair outside of the representative&#8217;s office. Only one other woman is in the hallway, standing a  few yards away. She&#8217;s colored, the same shade of mahogany as my mother. I smile at her. She smiles back, shyly, and looks away. I have never seen another colored female pilot before, but I know that is what I&#8217;m looking at the minute I see her. There&#8217;s something straight in the way she stands that says she&#8217;s seen what the world looks like from the clouds. I open my mouth to say something, anything, to her, when I remember my new place. Jolene was right. White women don&#8217;t ask colored women if they can fly.</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s my turn to drop my eyes shyly. My stomach turns over and my skin prickles as a blush of shame spreads over me. I don&#8217;t feel white, but I do feel less like Ida Mae. I wait in the hall in the hard wooden chair and wonder if I&#8217;ve made a mistake. After all, if she&#8217;s here, maybe they would take me as I am, too. And then I could talk to this woman. My palms start to sweat. This is going to be harder than I thought.</div><div class="tx">A minute later, the office door opens and a girl with a milkmaid complexion and light brown hair comes out of her interview smiling in her Sunday best. She turns her broad smile on me. &#8220;Good luck!&#8221; she says, and she hurries toward the elevator.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Janet Weakes,&#8221; the secretary calls. Janet Weakes is the colored woman. She nods and goes into the office, shutting the door behind her.</div><div class="tx">Her interview does not take long. Three minutes later she emerges, her head held high, but her face holds the opposite of the smile the milkmaid wore. She does not look at me or at the secretary, just shakes her head and waits for the elevator to arrive.</div><div class="tx">I watch her back, her shoulders, the chestnut brown legs beneath her charcoal gray dress suit. And I know that she&#8217;s  been turned away because of that deep brown skin. I take a tissue from my purse and fiddle with it, trying to dry my palms and stop the feeling that ants are marching up and down my spine. I wish Jolene was here. But she&#8217;s not. I guess that&#8217;s what it means to pass for white&#8212;suddenly, you&#8217;re all alone.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida Mae Jones,&#8221; the secretary calls out.</div><div class="tx">My knees go weak, but I stand. I clutch my purse, my makeshift pilot&#8217;s license a good luck charm in my hands. You do want to fly, don&#8217;t you? The voice is Jolene&#8217;s, or maybe it&#8217;s my father. I can&#8217;t tell. All I know is the answer is yes.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">The interviewer has a real serious look on her face, like Mama when I&#8217;d bring home a not-so-good grade. I hesitate inside the doorway, drop a small curtsy, then bring it up short, realizing I&#8217;ll look like the help that way instead of a white lady pilot.</div><div class="tx">The woman sitting behind the desk is fair-skinned, with dark hair cut into an efficient if unfashionable bob and a sprinkling of freckles. She looks more like a flapper than a military officer. In fact, she&#8217;s not wearing a uniform, just a skirt suit of navy blue wool.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You know,&#8221; she says abruptly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve met more than a few good women pilots out there . . . but good flying isn&#8217;t the only qualification. It&#8217;s a shame.&#8221; She looks past me into the hallway. I follow her gaze and let the door shut behind me. The colored woman has come and gone, but it looks like she&#8217;s on both of our minds.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; I say, and tug my gloves off my hands.</div><div class="tx">She looks up at me. &#8220;Say, nice hat.&#8221; I feel myself blush and mutter a thank-you. So much for my newfound confidence.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Elisabeth Murphy,&#8221; the interviewer introduces herself,  standing up behind the desk. I come forward to take her outstretched hand and curse myself for taking off my gloves. What if her skin is fairer against mine? I smile and shake her hand, hoping to distract her.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida Mae Jones.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s my smile or the fact that I&#8217;m a hundred shades lighter than the lady who just left, but Elisabeth Murphy doesn&#8217;t seem to realize she&#8217;s shaking hands with a colored housemaid.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Pleasure, Miss Jones. It is &#8216;miss,&#8217; I take it? Few husbands allow their wives the freedom to fly, let alone join the armed services.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I laugh in nervous relief and take the offered chair. &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s &#8216;miss,&#8217; all right. Much to my mother&#8217;s dismay.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Elisabeth Murphy laughs. &#8220;Ah, yes, the single woman&#8217;s burden, a lovingly over-involved mother. What does she say about you being here today?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I take a deep breath. I don&#8217;t know what I expected Uncle Sam to ask me today, but this is not it.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Actually, ma&#8217;am, she doesn&#8217;t know. I mean, she knows about the program. I couldn&#8217;t help but tell her, but I don&#8217;t want her to know about this until it&#8217;s for sure. She&#8217;s . . . well, it&#8217;d take some doing for her to see another child off to war as a good thing. So she doesn&#8217;t really know.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I study my shoes, embarrassed by how young I must sound. I blush and my skin gets even darker when I think about the truth. How angry my mother would be at me for using Daddy&#8217;s license to be somebody I&#8217;m not. How she&#8217;d just die inside if she knew I was playing white.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You know, maybe this was a mistake.&#8221; I start to rise, clutching at my purse, trying to pull back on my gloves. My face is hot, my skin prickling. Whatever confidence made me  think I could do this is gone. That feeling of certainty I felt in the attic, holding Daddy&#8217;s pilot&#8217;s license, has left me, replaced with a cold, stinging sureness that I am about to get into more trouble than I can possibly handle.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I can&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t understand, Miss Jones, but the type of pilots we need are getting hard to come by. Lots of eager girls, but not ones with the right attitude. You came in here and you curtsied, first thing. That&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t see every day, except on the base, where we salute our superiors. It shows a humility a lot of kids don&#8217;t have today. A humility our boys are learning every day we fight overseas. It&#8217;d be a shame if we didn&#8217;t at least finish the interview and see where it goes. Who knows, maybe your mother will come around if she knows that you are special enough to make it into the WASP.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I can&#8217;t believe my ears. Here&#8217;s this white lady, smiling encouragingly at me. She&#8217;s come all the way from Washington, D.C. And she wants me. Ida Mae Jones.</div><div class="tx">Elisabeth Murphy nods at the chair.</div><div class="tx">I close my eyes. <i>Mama, forgive me.</i></div><div class="tx">I follow Mrs. Murphy&#8217;s lead. She sits down. I slowly, slowly follow.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Good. Now, that was the hard part. Being sure you want to be here. So, convince me. What makes this worthwhile to you? It&#8217;s a hard life; you might not make it through training. Most girls don&#8217;t. And people in your hometown will not understand. But I know you know that already. So why, Miss Ida Mae Jones? Why do you want to be a WASP?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I swallow hard, but the answer is easy. &#8220;Because, Miss Murphy. I want to fly again. I want to fly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Elisabeth Murphy nods slowly. &#8220;That&#8217;s not good enough.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I feel myself start to blush again. Stop it, Ida Mae, don&#8217;t  show this woman who you are, don&#8217;t give it away now, now that you&#8217;ve decided to stay. And then I realize, that&#8217;s it, show her <i>who</i> I am, not what I am. I am Ida Mae Jones of Slidell, Louisiana. Even if I&#8217;m playing at being white, even if I paint myself blue, I am still the child of my parents, still that little girl who loves her brother and loves to fly.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;My daddy brought home a Curtiss JN-4 when I was eleven years old. He taught me how to fly her, and that plane was my first real friend, aside from my brother Thomas. Daddy used to say the only time we are free is when our feet are off the ground.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, a lot of people don&#8217;t think women can fly,&#8221; Elisabeth Murphy says. &#8220;Certainly not military planes. But that&#8217;s what the WASP are here to do&#8212;prove them wrong.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; I smile self-consciously. Pay attention, Ida Mae. Don&#8217;t forget what line you&#8217;re walking. I take a deep breath and start again.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;So, when the war started, and the Japanese bombed our own ships and our own soil, my brother went off to fight to keep us free in his way. He&#8217;s doing his part, and I want to do mine. Now, I can stay at home stretching flour rations and collecting nylons, or I can do what God and my daddy taught me to do. I can fly. I can fly straight and far or however the army needs me to. I learn quick and well. And I just know, if you give me a chance, I can do as good a job or better than any&#8212;&#8221; I have to stop myself from saying &#8220;white woman.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Elisabeth Murphy smiles. &#8220;Go ahead, finish your sentence. &#8216;Better than any man.&#8217;&#8221; She grins more broadly. &#8220;Good. You need that kind of spirit. The army is a hard place for a woman, Miss Jones. And the Women Airforce Service Pilot program is even harder. We have a lot to prove. The men don&#8217;t think we  have it in us to fly, let alone fly for the government. We&#8217;ll show them otherwise, but it takes determination and skill. We can teach you the skills. But you have to bring the rest.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She looks at me for a long moment, and I can hear my heart pounding in my ears. Slowly, my shoulders relax. What am I first, I wonder, a woman or colored?</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t look so concerned, Miss Jones. Tell your mother there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll wash out in the first month, and you&#8217;ll be home with your tail between your legs ready to listen to all of her &#8216;told you so&#8217;s&#8217; and settle down to make fat, happy babies.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Elisabeth Murphy flips through the files on her desk. I resist the urge to mop my forehead with the handkerchief tucked into my handbag.</div><div class="tx">She eyes me. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t think so. Now, did you bring your license?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My heart skips a beat. &#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; I feel like I&#8217;m moving in molasses when I hand Daddy&#8217;s license over to her. I hope the glue stays stuck, I hope the typing looks official. I hope a lifetime&#8217;s worth of hoping. And then she&#8217;s nodding and handing it back to me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Congratulations. This is only the first step.&#8221; She thrusts out her hand. I take it, bewildered.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Expect papers to arrive in about a week. If they give you the final go-ahead, training for the next class starts in one month. Texas. Ever been?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I shake my head slowly, dazed. She shrugs and hands me her card. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll get enough of it soon. You can reach me at that address if you, or that mother of yours, have any questions.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I rise to my feet for the second time, light-headed with  disbelief. I forget myself and curtsy again. &#8220;Thank you, ma&#8217;am. Thank you very much.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I want to whoop for joy. A grin slides across my face. Jolene will never believe this. Not until there is a letter in my hand signed by President Roosevelt himself. And even then, she&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m fooling.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;There&#8217;s that curtsy again. Good luck, Miss Jones.&#8221; Elisabeth Murphy opens the door. &#8220;You&#8217;ll need it.&#8221;</div></body></html>';

Sound travels farther than I ever thought, out here in the strawberry fields. I turn around to see who&#8217;s been following me from the turn off the road. It takes a second for me to realize who he&#8217;s talking about. Me.</div><div class="tx">I walk down the little road that becomes our driveway, gloves on my hands and Mrs. Wilson&#8217;s hat still perched on top of my head, my face half hidden behind the blue veil . . . I forgot to change, I wanted to get home so bad. Well, there&#8217;s nothing to do about it now. I can bring the hat and stole back tomorrow morning. The stockings feel silky against my legs. No wonder Jolene loves them so much. I&#8217;ll have to wash them and give them back to her scented with lavender perfume to say thank you.</div><div class="tx">The farmhouse door opens up and Mama steps out on the porch. The minute she looks at me, I know she doesn&#8217;t see a white lady. She sees something else. Her face goes blank.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hi, Mama,&#8221; I say, and close the last few feet between me and the front steps. She lets me get halfway up, her hands resting lightly clasped in front of her apron. I smile up at her and she slaps me. Hard. Tears fill my eyes.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Mama!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you &#8216;mama&#8217; me, Ida Mae Jones. One look and I can tell what you&#8217;ve been doing. Playing at that same mess as  your daddy&#8217;s people. Do you think white folks don&#8217;t know? Do you think they can&#8217;t tell what you are? A high yellow putting on airs and a borrowed hat.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She comes toward me, all the way to the last step, and holds on to the banister, as if she is on a ship and I have gone overboard, lost at sea.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You take back that hat and those stockings and whatever ideas have gotten into your head, girl. You are part of <i>this</i> family. All the clothes in the world can&#8217;t change that.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I blink back my tears. My mouth opens, but I don&#8217;t know what to say. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think . . .&#8221;</div><div class="tx">And then I see the tears in my mother&#8217;s eyes.</div><div class="tx">The porch door swings open and Abel peeks out. &#8220;Ida?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The look Mama gives him sends him scampering away. I hear the side door slam open and shut and I know he&#8217;s gone to find Grandy. I drop to my knees in the dust of the driveway, the gravel scraping the tender stockings on my legs. I can&#8217;t look at anything but the gloves on my hands. Mama&#8217;s Sunday gloves.</div><div class="tx">I hear Mama go back up the stairs. The front door creaks and she&#8217;s gone.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Go clean yourself up, Ida,&#8221; Grandy says as he comes around the side of the house, his work boots crunching on the gravel. &#8220;Then you can explain yourself.&#8221; I look up and Abel is hiding, scared, behind Grandy&#8217;s legs. Neither of them reaches to help me as I pull myself up to my feet. No one holds the door for me when I follow them inside.</div><div class="tx">In the bathroom, I wash my face twice. The red rims around my eyes won&#8217;t go away and neither will the tender bruising where my mother slapped me for the first time in my life. I give up and finish getting dressed. There is a tiny hole  in Jolene&#8217;s nylons, right on the knee. Maybe it won&#8217;t run. Maybe I can buy her a new pair.</div><div class="tx">The girl in the mirror looks hollow. Big dark eyes like empty wells. I look unnaturally pale, sickly, almost green.</div><div class="tx">I turn away from my reflection and hang Jolene&#8217;s hose up to dry. Adjusting the straps on my overalls, I go downstairs to pay the piper.</div><div class="tx">Grandy and Abel are sitting at the kitchen table. I wish Abel wasn&#8217;t here for this. There are things he shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about until he&#8217;s older. But Mama&#8217;s always made us sit through each other&#8217;s talking-tos so we both learn the lesson with only one of us having made the mistake. Mama jumps up from her chair the minute I come in and goes to the window. She won&#8217;t look at me. I stand in front of all of them, unsure if I should sit down. Unsure if I&#8217;m welcome.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I knew one day you&#8217;d go to see her,&#8221; Mama says, her voice strained and quiet.</div><div class="tx">I blink in confusion. &#8220;Mama?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She turns around and her eyes are as red as mine. &#8220;Don&#8217;t &#8216;mama&#8217; me, girl. You know who I&#8217;m talking about. Was this for her?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I swallow hard, all the pieces falling into place. &#8220;No. This wasn&#8217;t about Grandm&#232;re Boudreaux.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My father&#8217;s mother, French-speaking, Creole, light-skinned Grandm&#232;re Boudreaux, has money and status that goes with her maiden name. She&#8217;s my daddy&#8217;s only immediate family and we&#8217;ve never even met. I know where her house is, on one of those streets uptown in the Garden District of New Orleans, one of the old houses built for the free people of color before the Civil War. A fashionable neighborhood for the almost white. The rest of my family would never dare set foot  there&#8212;Thomas&#8217;s hair&#8217;s too kinky, Abel&#8217;s skin too brown. But I&#8217;ve got the right complexion, the right texture to my hair. I&#8217;d fit right in.</div><div class="tx">She could take me to Paris if she wanted to, to where colored women can learn to fly. Just like Bessie Coleman, the first colored woman pilot. Of course, with my father&#8217;s mother, I wouldn&#8217;t need to be colored if I didn&#8217;t want to be.</div><div class="tx">I never knew my mother was afraid of that fact until now.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">My father&#8217;s people were town people, city folks who followed opportunity the way a compass follows north. Sometime back, one of them found herself with child by a white man. They steered that half-colored girl down a path that made each generation lighter than light, having children by white men and marrying those children to other mixed coloreds, lighter and whiter until my father was born.</div><div class="tx">Daddy was destined to marry a white woman, to be a <i>pass&#233; blanc</i> and give his family a better lot in life. But Daddy wasn&#8217;t an opportunist. He was a romantic, and his heart chose Mama. Grandm&#232;re Boudreaux never forgave Daddy for his choice of a brown-skinned bride or his career as a strawberry farmer, which he learned from Grandy and mixed with his college learning. Grandm&#232;re drove out to our house only once, when I was nine years old, to have a look at us, as Daddy said. A look was all it was, too.</div><div class="tx">She drove up in a brand-new Studebaker caked with country dust. Our dust. The back window rolled down slowly as the car came to a stop at the end of our driveway. It never turned to come up to the house.</div><div class="tx">From the front steps, itching in my Sunday best, between a stiff-jawed Thomas and an unusually quiet Mama, I caught  my only glimpse of Grandm&#232;re Boudreaux through that open window. She was fair. Not like milk, but cream, the good kind you pour into coffee on special occasions, the same shade as the paper flowers in Mama&#8217;s old Easter hat. Her hair fell in soft, graying finger waves, like a movie star. Her powdered skin was set in an expression so severe it looked like it hurt. Her mouth was a firm red slash in that pale, pale face.</div><div class="tx">One of her gloved fingers went up in the air, like she was pointing at a bird. The window rolled back up and the Studebaker drove away.</div><div class="tx">Mama harrumphed, the way she does when she knows I&#8217;m lying, and marched us back inside to put on our regular play clothes. Daddy just sat down on the front steps, his hat in his hands, and hung his head. I&#8217;d never seen him like that before. Later that night, when Mama gave me my bath, I asked her how I could be like Grandm&#232;re. Her jaw clenched real tight and she said, &#8220;Marry a white man.&#8221;</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Mama seems to deflate when she hears I haven&#8217;t been to see Grandm&#232;re Boudreaux, a sigh of relief that loosens her shoulders and makes her seem like my mother again. Grandy sighs and gets up from the table. My eyes follow his back as he starts to make a pot of coffee.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Young woman, you&#8217;d best not be setting after a fella like that,&#8221; he says without turning around.</div><div class="tx">I blush, but it&#8217;s a feeling of relief. &#8220;Only one fella, Grandy. Thomas.&#8221; That gets everyone&#8217;s attention, even Abel. Grandy comes back to the table but doesn&#8217;t sit down. Mama sits real still, her eyes on me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I had an interview. To join the Women Airforce Service Pilots. And it looks like I might have a shot.&#8221; I smile in spite  of myself and drop it just as fast. No one&#8217;s saying anything. I swallow hard. &#8220;Remember that article Abel gave me?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Abel ducks his head so Mama can&#8217;t see his smile.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, Lord,&#8221; Grandy says under his breath.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What are you talking about, girl?&#8221; Mama asks. &#8220;You might be able to fake white, but even you can&#8217;t fake being a pilot.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I didn&#8217;t think I could feel more ashamed than I already did, but leave it to Mama to get me there.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I used Daddy&#8217;s license,&#8221; I say quietly. Now I&#8217;m the one ducking my head.</div><div class="tx">My mother gets up and walks away. I can&#8217;t let it happen like this.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Just listen to me. Listen to me!&#8221; I all but shout, and Mama stops in her tracks. I&#8217;ve never raised my voice to her and gotten away with it. But I&#8217;m not a little girl anymore.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Somebody has got to do something. So I went. I put my name on Daddy&#8217;s license and I went and got an interview. And you know what? I wasn&#8217;t hiding anything when I went into that room and sat face-to-face with an actual woman Army Air Forces pilot. And do you know what she saw? Not a Negro woman, not a white woman, not a high yellow. But a pilot, Mama. A good pilot that they need. Don&#8217;t you see? This is what Daddy used to fly for. The chance to be everything other than the color of his skin.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">No one says anything and I realize I&#8217;m on my feet and my heart is beating fast.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Maybe Uncle Sam doesn&#8217;t care about Thomas. Maybe a colored soldier doesn&#8217;t have a chance in the world. But I do, Mama. So what if they think I&#8217;m white? Let them see what they want to see. I&#8217;m still me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama laughs then, a low chuckle. She leans up against the  doorjamb and for a minute she doesn&#8217;t look like my mama anymore. She looks like the woman in my parents&#8217; wedding picture&#8212;young and full of pride. The picture ran in the paper, the only time Daddy&#8217;s mother ever saw her new daughter-in-law up close.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Baby, you don&#8217;t know what you are getting into. You do not know. But your daddy did. He knew what his mother was asking of him, every day to turn his head away from his people but never really hold his head up with white folks, either. Always looking in the mirror, making sure his hair stayed straight, his skin stayed light. Do you know there&#8217;s a whole side to his family he wasn&#8217;t allowed to see? Didn&#8217;t want to be marked &#8216;colored&#8217; by association. Are you prepared for that? Are you willing to give up your brothers? Grandy? Me?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I don&#8217;t say anything. We are &#8220;that&#8221; side of the family, because Daddy married Mama. My jaw tightens, but I don&#8217;t back down. I&#8217;ve gotten this far. I&#8217;m not going to let anything stop me now. Besides, plenty of folks have passed for a better job, like Stevia Johnson. What I&#8217;m doing is no different, except it can help my brother win the war.</div><div class="tx">Mama must see the determination in my face because she leans in close and jabs a finger into the tabletop. &#8220;Listen to me, girl. Because you are young and you don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m here to tell you: you cross that line, you cannot cross back just as you please. Look at her, at Mrs. Genevi&#232;ve Boudreaux, too proud to even visit her own grandchildren or go to her son&#8217;s funeral! And now this . . .&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama shakes her head. &#8220;I hope to God you don&#8217;t get in. I hope to God you never have to learn what your daddy already knew.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She looks at me with such sorrow, I think my heart will break.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida Mae.&#8221; Every fear, every hope, a dozen slaps, and a thousand hugs are in those two words, my name. She repeats it: &#8220;Ida Mae.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">On the stove, Grandy&#8217;s coffee comes to a boil.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Abel, want a sugar lump of coffee?&#8221; Grandy has stayed quiet through all of this. I&#8217;m Mama&#8217;s child to raise, not his. If he has something to say, he&#8217;ll take it up with her later.</div><div class="tx">Abel happily scrambles off his chair to get a saucer for his little sip of coffee. Grandy puts a half spoon of sugar on the saucer and adds two spoonfuls of coffee. Thomas and I used to do the same thing when we were his age.</div><div class="tx">The house feels stuffy all of a sudden. &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna get some air,&#8221; I say.</div><div class="tx">Grandy nods and pours a cup of coffee for himself and for Mama. I hear them out on the porch rocking and murmuring low as I find a place to sit down in the fields. The stars are coming out. I count them, and my blessings, and wonder if Mama is right.</div></body></html>';

Jolene and I work our fingers to the quick, rubbing beeswax into the wood floors at the Wilson place.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;If ever there was a reason to fly,&#8221; I tell Jolene, &#8220;it would be to save me from having to wax floors.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Shoot, fly all you want,&#8221; she replies. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather be rich.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">By the time we leave for the day, we are worn down to the bone, but the floors shine like honey in the late-afternoon light. Otis Wilson has shipped off for basic training. He looked like a sad puppy in his best travel suit, ready to face the Nazis head-on. Mrs. Wilson was so proud, but his daddy knew better. Otis Wilson is not cut out for war. Jolene and I baked him some thumbprint cookies with his favorite jam, just to keep him company on the bus.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida Mae, ain&#8217;t that the mailman?&#8221; Jolene asks as we turn the last corner toward home. Jolene lives less than a mile from my place, and we usually walk a ways together. But today, when we step off the bus, the mailman is waving at me. We break into a run.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Here you go, Miss Ida Mae. I knew you was looking for something in the mail, but I didn&#8217;t know what. Says United States Armed Forces right on the envelope, so I figured it was something important.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Are you gonna open it or what?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The letter feels like a weight in my hand. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; I say, but my fingers don&#8217;t comply.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Give it here.&#8221; Jolene takes the envelope from me and rips it open with one dark brown finger. She reads the letter, and I try reading her face, but her brown eyes and her smooth forehead tell me nothing.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Jolene,&#8221; I finally manage to say.</div><div class="tx">She raises an eyebrow and looks at me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Texas? You&#8217;re really gonna go to Texas?&#8221; She stuffs the letter back in its envelope. &#8220;Shoot, girl, you&#8217;re crazy.&#8221; She hands the letter back to me. &#8220;Go on, tell your mama. I&#8217;ll watch the fireworks from my front porch.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She saunters away, leaving me standing in my cleaning uniform in the dust. I drop my bags and tear into the envelope, devouring the letter as it unfolds in my hands. <i>Pleased to offer . . . Report to training . . .</i> My heart starts beating faster and faster, like the train that will carry me off to Sweetwater, Texas.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Jolene!&#8221; I holler at her. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a WASP.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She&#8217;s grinning at me from a few yards down the road. I take a picture of her with my mind. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;ll see her, I tell myself, whenever I get to missing her. But I&#8217;m on my way to flying.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Mama&#8217;s walking the fields with Grandy when I reach the house. My acceptance letter is tucked into my pocket. I think about hiding it, but there is no point. Grandy sees me coming and waves. He and Mama cut across the strawberry plants and meet me in the driveway.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hey, baby girl, back from work late, huh.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We did a lot of extra work. The Wilsons are having folks over for dinner,&#8221; I explain. I hold up the envelope. &#8220;This just came. The WASP accepted me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama doesn&#8217;t say anything. She just stares at me. Grandy takes off his hat and wipes the sweat from his forehead.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We&#8217;ve had such a long day,&#8221; he says, and shakes his head. &#8220;Come on, we&#8217;ll talk about it over dinner.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">They head into the house. I stand outside just a moment longer, the evening wind rising around my ankles, tossing the hem of my dress.</div><div class="tx">There&#8217;s ham casserole for dinner, the last of the meat from Sunday&#8217;s big meal, with noodles and bread crumbs and mayonnaise in the sauce. Usually, everyone likes ham casserole. It&#8217;s hot and tasty and sticks to your ribs. Tonight, I push it around on my plate, and I&#8217;m not alone.</div><div class="tx">Mama stares at her plate.</div><div class="tx">Abel pokes at his food. He&#8217;s always either hungry as a wolf or finicky as a cat. Tonight&#8217;s got him jumpy.</div><div class="tx">Only Grandy seems to have an appetite. He chases forkfuls of meat and noodles around with a slice of bread. Grandy has been a farmer his whole life. He won&#8217;t waste a meal, no matter what else is going on.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now,&#8221; he says when he&#8217;s satisfied. He sits back and takes a sip of black coffee. &#8220;How do you think this is going to work, Ida Mae?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I blink. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m due at the training camp in two weeks, and then I either make it or I don&#8217;t and I come home again.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Are they paying for you to go?&#8221; Mama asks. Those are the first words she&#8217;s said on the subject since the fight in the kitchen over a week ago.</div><div class="tx">I glance down at the table, the letter memorized already. &#8220;No, Mama. They say I&#8217;ve got to pay my own way. But it makes sense, right? I mean, I haven&#8217;t actually become a WASP yet.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama sighs and stirs some molasses into her coffee cup. Sugar is too hard to come by to use it every day.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got my Chicago money I&#8217;ve been saving. I can pay my own way.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Chicago,&#8221; Mama says with a shake of her head. &#8220;I should never have let you carry on about that.&#8221; She looks so tired it makes my heart ache.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Come to that,&#8221; Grandy says, &#8220;what about rest of your pay, Ida? We all work together in this family. With you gone, that&#8217;s another bit of money that&#8217;s not coming in for us,&#8221; he points out. I swallow and nod.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I can set some aside for you and Mama and Abel from my savings. Then there&#8217;s a stipend during training, $150 a month. I can send some of it to you. And when I get assigned, I&#8217;ll be making a real paycheck. I can send money then.&#8221; It suddenly feels possible and real. I can do this, I know I can make it work.</div><div class="tx">Grandy doesn&#8217;t sound convinced. &#8220;So, you have to buy a train ticket and be gone for who knows how long . . .&#8221; He shakes his head and turns to Mama. &#8220;Well, Stella, she wouldn&#8217;t be the first colored girl who passed for an opportunity. And flying for the military&#8212;that&#8217;s a big one.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama&#8217;s face stays carefully blank. &#8220;How many of those girls ever come back?&#8221; she asks Grandy quietly.</div><div class="tx">Grandy nods and rubs a big hand slowly over his cropped white hair. &#8220;Sure, there&#8217;s that. But if they keep the men and women anywhere near as separate as they keep the Negroes  and whites, ain&#8217;t no convent gonna be safer, despite what they say about them WACs.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama stays silent. Grandy shrugs. &#8220;Besides, what are we gonna do for her here? The girl&#8217;s got the bug, just like her daddy. It&#8217;s the army or Chicago one of these days, and nobody&#8217;s watching out for her in Chicago.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama looks at her hands in her lap. When she looks up at Grandy again, I can tell a decision&#8217;s been made.</div><div class="tx">Grandy shakes his head. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to tell you, Ida Mae, this is one for the record books,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I mean, a little colored girl flying for old Uncle Sam.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Does that mean I can go?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Grandy shrugs. &#8220;Your mama and I have been talking. And you&#8217;re not a baby anymore. An adult has to make adult decisions.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I look at Mama. All the planning in the world won&#8217;t matter if she says no to me. I can&#8217;t stand to break her heart.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;If it&#8217;ll help Thomas,&#8221; Mama says at last. I can hear the resignation in her voice and it pains me. But a yes is still a yes.</div><div class="tx">I slump back into my chair, glad to have Grandy&#8217;s blessing, stunned to have Mama&#8217;s, no matter how begrudging.</div><div class="tx">I start to ask if they&#8217;re sure, but it&#8217;s not worth having them change their minds, so I hold my tongue.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Show me that letter,&#8221; Grandy says. I pull it out of my pocket and place it on the table. Grandy takes it and gives a low whistle.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Texas. Uh-uh. Texas is hard, baby girl, hard for the colored man. You&#8217;ve got to be extra careful not to slip up. They won&#8217;t take kindly to it in Texas. And if anybody asks or even suspects something, tell them you&#8217;ve got Spanish blood on  your mother&#8217;s side. More than a few folks around here claiming Spanish Creole blood.&#8221; He gives me a look of concern that turns into concentration. &#8220;I got a few friends out by Sweetwater. It&#8217;s not much to look at, from what I hear.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I can&#8217;t help but smile. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be looking at the clouds.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Grandy grins. He pats me on the arm. Abel gives me the thumbs-up. Mama gets up and gathers the dishes. I start to help and she waves me away.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Just sit down. I&#8217;ve got to get used to doing this by myself,&#8221; she says. There&#8217;s nothing I can do but watch as she carries the plates to the kitchen sink and begins washing them one by one. She&#8217;s humming &#8220;Amazing Grace&#8221; as she washes. The same song we sing every Sunday in church, but tonight I can only remember it as the hymn we sang over my father&#8217;s grave.</div></body></html>';

For I belong to somebody . . .&#8221; I hum to myself like the words can keep away the fear gnawing at my insides. Those two weeks have flown by and here I am, itchy in my travel suit, a wool skirt and matching jacket, white gloves. I wish Abel was here to sing with me, to hold my hand. The only brown faces I&#8217;ve seen are on the side of the road, working in prison gangs. This is the last leg of my journey, the bus from Sweetwater to the WASP base at Avenger Field.</div><div class="tx">The bus was waiting for us outside the Blue Bonnet Hotel in town. I even had a room for a night at the hotel without anyone sending me across the tracks to the Negro neighborhood. The night was cool enough for me to smooth out my hair with an iron, and it stayed straight all the way up until we got on this bus. That&#8217;s when I learned that Texas is hot. Hot enough to make even my good hair go frizzy from sweat. I check to make sure I have enough setting cream to keep it tame, even if my curls get wet. In the summer in Slidell, it can get so you wish you could take off your own skin. Stripping down to your bloomers just isn&#8217;t enough. Some days are so humid, you can&#8217;t tell where the air ends and your sweat begins. Like being in a wet oven, that&#8217;s what Slidell summers are like. But this Texas heat is like desert heat. It&#8217;s drier than dry, but you sweat in it just the same.</div><div class="tx">I resist the urge to put a hand to my hair, because it&#8217;ll only  make it worse. Instead, I end up fidgeting with my handbag. I&#8217;m like to tear the handle off before we get to our destination.</div><div class="tx">Pretending to be white is like holding your stomach in at the lake when the boys walk by. You know they&#8217;re looking, but you don&#8217;t want to be seen the way you really are, tummy all soft and babyish, with a too-small chest and behind. So you stand up tall, suck it in, tilt it forward, and try to do the best you can. Jolene was always better at posing. A regular Jean Harlow. Not me. I suck it up, stick it out, and I&#8217;m surer than sure I&#8217;ll never get to the end of this bus ride without being found out.</div><div class="tx">I look around, trying not to show that I&#8217;m moving my eyes. I&#8217;m not the only one in gloves. I sigh, relieved. Now that I&#8217;ve made it this far, I&#8217;ll do anything not to stand out. I close my eyes and remember the last time I felt this scared. Right before my flight test in Alabama, when I didn&#8217;t get my license. Not a good sign.</div><div class="tx">There are twenty-five of us. There are supposed to be a hundred girls in all, but I guess the rest have cars or came out yesterday. At eight o&#8217;clock this morning, the bus pulled up to take us to Avenger Field. It&#8217;s a queer one. They call it a cattle truck, but it looks more like a long horse trailer, a big metal box with rectangles cut out for the windows, although there isn&#8217;t even any glass. And the hard seats seem like an afterthought. It makes me wonder what kind of planes they&#8217;ve given us. But I don&#8217;t care what they look like. I just want to get there.</div><div class="tx">For the first time since leaving New Orleans, I don&#8217;t need to think about sitting in the back or the front. I&#8217;m squeezed square into the middle of all the other girls. I say girls, but some of them are women, all right. In age, they look to be anywhere from my age to a little younger than Mama. There  are brunettes, blondes, redheads, and even a few people going gray early. And every single one of them is white.</div><div class="tx">I wipe the sweat from my forehead with a folded handkerchief. I feel sick.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Are you all right, sister?&#8221; The girl across from me is looking at me with concern. She looks like Snow White, all black curls, ruby lips, and creamy skin, eyes like blue forget-me-nots. I wave her away.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m fine, thank you,&#8221; I say. I fight the urge to add &#8220;ma&#8217;am&#8221; or bow my head. Jolene warned me not to be a maid. I twist my fingers in the fabric of my skirt.</div><div class="tx">The woman smiles. &#8220;The hell you are. None of us are. How could we be, with this damn heat, this damn bus, and&#8212;&#8221; She pauses. &#8220;Well, I ran out of <i>damns.</i> How old are you, honey?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Twenty last month,&#8221; I tell her. I really do think I might be sick. &#8220;I need some water.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hold on. Driver?&#8221; Snow White is up and walking down the bouncing bus aisle with perfect balance. I would have tripped over myself with all of this jouncing, but Snow White is cool as November, a real beauty queen.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hey, Mack,&#8221; she says to the driver. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a sick girl back here. Do you have something she can drink?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The driver fumbles around for a canteen under his seat. I put my head down on my knees, dizzy. My hands shake and my stomach turns sour. Drinking from a &#8220;whites-only&#8221; water fountain would earn me a beating back home. Sharing this man&#8217;s canteen could be a hanging offense in Texas for all I know. But then I steel myself. You wanted to fly, Ida Mae. This is what it takes.</div><div class="tx">A moment later, Snow White&#8217;s lifting my head up with a cool, dry hand. &#8220;Here, honey, take a sip. It&#8217;ll help.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I sit up and put my lips to the metal rim of the canteen. A split second before it touches my lips, I realize it&#8217;s not water. The rich, fiery smell of whiskey hits my nostrils. I push it away, eyes burning from the fumes. The liquor has splashed my mouth. I wipe it away with my handkerchief. Some of the other girls around me laugh and whisper. And all I wanted to do was lie low.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Better?&#8221; Snow White asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s not water,&#8221; I say hoarsely.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, I know, honey. But this rotgut is almost as good as smelling salts. You&#8217;ll be all right now, at least until we get to the base.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I sit up straight and stare at Snow White. My cheeks get hot, but I don&#8217;t say anything. I don&#8217;t feel anywhere near &#8220;all right.&#8221; My hands are still trembling, but now it&#8217;s as much from embarrassment as it is from fear.</div><div class="tx">Snow White smiles. &#8220;Oh, honey, I&#8217;m not messing with you. I was trying to help, really. I was afraid you&#8217;d pass out before we got to the base, and then they&#8217;d send you right back home.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I can feel my face go from red to gray. &#8220;Of course. Thank you.&#8221; I cover my eyes with my hand and sigh. &#8220;This is going to be harder than I thought.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; Snow White says. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get through it somehow.&#8221; I give her a wry smile. I hope she&#8217;s right.</div><div class="tx">Snow White sticks out her hand. &#8220;The name&#8217;s Patsy, Patsy Kake. You can call me Cakewalk.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida Mae Jones.&#8221; I shake her hand. This time, I can&#8217;t help but bob my head, like a seated curtsy. She doesn&#8217;t seem to notice.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Pleased to meet you, Jonesy.&#8221; I start to correct her and  decide against it. The less I am Ida Mae, the better off I&#8217;ll be. Patsy&#8217;s hand is cool in mine. We give each other a tentative smile.</div><div class="tx">The other women are whispering excitedly and looking out the window at the flat, unending plains. I want to be home in Slidell. I want to sit at the edge of the berry fields and spread my toes in the grass and never hear another word about the war again.</div><div class="tx">Then the bus driver lets out a shout. All of the girls on the bus stand up at once. Airplanes are flying overhead.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That sounds like an AT-6,&#8221; one of the girls says. I don&#8217;t recognize the name from the spotter cards Thomas sent me and Abel: like a playing deck but with pictures of both U.S. and enemy planes so we could identify them in case of an air raid. &#8220;That&#8217;s an Advanced Trainer,&#8221; another girl says, which explains why I don&#8217;t know it. I&#8217;ve got every plane on that card deck memorized, but they&#8217;re the real deal, not teaching planes. Some of these girls must have family in the air force to know what a military trainer plane looks like.</div><div class="tx">Like a bunch of tourists, the other girls scramble to see the AT-6, racing to the left side of the bus. Me, I sit real still and let the sound of the buzzing engines wash over me. My stomach settles right down, like a perfect three-point landing. I&#8217;m here, I tell myself. Daddy would be proud.</div><div class="tx">Outside the window, the sky is peppered with airplanes, taking off, landing, circling the field.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;There it is,&#8221; Patsy Kake says, grinning. &#8220;Avenger Field.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I tear my eyes away from the sky long enough to look at my new home. At first, I don&#8217;t see much. Just an old split-rail fence, followed by more pancake-flat dirt, going on for miles.  But then in front of us is a gate, an archway, really, like the ones in front of cowboy ranches in the movies. The wooden sign looks exactly the way I&#8217;ve seen it in the newspapers. A long dark rectangle with white letters that read AVIATION ENTERPRISES, LTD. In the center, above the words, a globe of the earth sits, wrapped with a small banner that says AVENGER FIELD. And flying above that globe, like she&#8217;s coming in for a landing, is the mascot of the WASP, Fifinella. I smile up at the girl gremlin. She&#8217;s a sight to see, with little horns and curling eyelashes. Her outfit is like nothing I&#8217;ve ever laid eyes on&#8212;blue flight goggles, an orange bomber jacket, glamorous elbow-length gloves, and yellow jodhpurs with a matching helmet. Her blue wings are spread out behind her, like she&#8217;s coming in fast.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s a Walt Disney original,&#8221; Patsy tells me.</div><div class="tx">I smile. &#8220;What a looker.&#8221; Gremlins are supposed to be nasty little devils. The flyboys in the Pacific say that the Japanese send these little troublemakers to tear up their airplanes and make flying harder. Fifinella is the exact opposite. She&#8217;s one of the good guys, here to help us women fly.</div><div class="tx">The guard at the little gatehouse waves us through. My butterflies return, but now they&#8217;re from excitement instead of nausea. After months of newspaper clippings and daydreams, I am finally going to fly in this man&#8217;s army.</div><div class="tx">I take a deep breath and step off the cattle truck onto the dry, powdered soil at Avenger Field. The noise of the planes overhead has my heart thumping. My fingers are itching to pull me inside a cockpit, but first things first.</div><div class="tx">We are greeted by an Army Air Forces officer with a stiff khaki uniform and an even stiffer frown.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Welcome to Avenger Field,&#8221; he says. The way he says it reminds me that this man&#8217;s army has been &#8220;men only&#8221; for a very long time. Not everyone is so happy to see us here.</div><div class="tx">They march us past the administrative building to what they call the training theater, where we will be processed. It&#8217;s an old white building that sits like a box on the flat earth. The low roof doesn&#8217;t make it any cooler in here. A small, kind-faced woman enters the room, a clipboard stacked with papers in her hands. She&#8217;s in uniform, a tailored blue skirt and matching jacket, with her dark brown hair cut into a neat bob.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Welcome to Avenger Field, ladies,&#8221; she says. Her voice has a no-nonsense kind of gentleness to it that reminds me right away of Mama. &#8220;My name is Leni Leoti Clark Deaton. I am the establishment officer here. Anything you need, anything concerning any WASP trainee, come to me and we will take care of you. For the next five months, you will be in training for the Women Airforce Service Pilots. Some of you will succeed, but most of you won&#8217;t. Take a look at the girl to the left of you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Dutifully, we all turn and look at the turned heads of our fellows. Some look like kids. Some look like movie stars. I can only guess how I must look to them.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now,&#8221; Mrs. Deaton says, &#8220;look at the girl to the right. Say goodbye to both of them today, because two out of every three of you will wash out before training is over. We want only the best, ladies. We keep only the best. Remember that.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">There&#8217;s some nervous shuffling, the kind you hear before a pop quiz in school. Everyone&#8217;s wondering who will be left standing in five months. I feel my stomach roll again and this time not from the heat. I clench my teeth and take a deep breath. <i>I will be here,</i> I tell myself. <i>I will be here.</i></div><div class="tx">I catch Patsy Kake smiling at me from the corner of my eye. Maybe she&#8217;ll be here, too. She&#8217;s got the attitude for it.</div><div class="tx">Mrs. Deaton passes around copies of a list of rules for living at the base. I glance down the sheet. No smoking, no drinking, no fraternizing with the instructors . . . the list goes on.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;All right, listen up, ladies,&#8221; she says. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be bunking in the barracks, six girls to a bay, two bays to a barrack. There&#8217;s a Jack and Jill bathroom accessible from both rooms, or Jill and Jill, if you like. No men are allowed in the barracks. The twelve of you will share this bathroom for the next five months. Make friends. It&#8217;ll go a lot easier that way.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mrs. Deaton&#8217;s voice is clear and mellow. It seems to carry from her small frame like a church bell, despite her size. We all listen attentively. &#8220;Barracks are broken up by alphabet. When I call your name, come stand beside me, and we&#8217;ll take you to the laundry, where you&#8217;ll pick up your sheets, and then on to your quarters. We are on a military clock here. The hands go from oh-one-hundred to twenty-four-hundred hours. It is now twelve o&#8217;clock, or twelve hundred hours. You have the afternoon to settle in. Supper is at eighteen hundred hours, or six o&#8217;clock. Get used to the hours, ladies. It will also make life easier.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now, Anderson, Attley, Boxer, Bradford, Cunningham, DeAngelo,&#8221; she begins calling off names. One by one, girls pull away from the crowd to stand by her side. They look nervous, every one of them. Me, I can hear the blood pounding in my ears. This is it. Anyone I room with could be my best friend or the person who turns me in. It&#8217;s all the luck of the draw.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Howard,&#8221;Mrs. Deaton calls out. &#8220;Jennings. Jones.&#8221; I almost  jump. A chill crawls up my spine and I step forward to join my new bunkmates. We don&#8217;t look at each other, just our feet, and wait for the rest of our group. I don&#8217;t know what to do with my hands, so I hold my purse with both of them. I don&#8217;t know what to do with my feet, so I stand there, heels close together, and wait.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Kake,&#8221; Mrs. Deaton calls. Patsy Kake smiles and sashays over to stand between Jennings and me. &#8220;Laidlaw. Lowenstein.&#8221; The last of the girls, Lowenstein, looks like a little bird, delicate bones and fine, chestnut-colored hair. She carries a heavy carpetbag with her in addition to her purse. The rest of us left our luggage on top of the bus, and I know I saw at least two steamer trunks up there with her name on it. I wonder what Lowenstein&#8217;s carrying that&#8217;s so important.</div><div class="tx">She carries the bag over to our little group. &#8220;Want some help, sister?&#8221; Patsy Kake offers her a hand. Lowenstein shakes her head politely. &#8220;No, thank you. I&#8217;m all right.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We fall silent until the rest of the girls are put into groups. Then, like we&#8217;re going to our own funeral, we silently fall into line as upperclassman trainees in khaki pants and white blouses lead us to our new homes.</div></body></html>';

She sticks her head in the bathroom door at the center of the middle wall. &#8220;Two mirrors and two showers. For twelve women? No wonder they say war is hell.&#8221; Seeing the close quarters, I thank my lucky stars I brought a new shower cap with me. The last thing I need is an audience of eleven catching me with my hair kinking up from the steam. It looks like I&#8217;ll be wearing braids most days.</div><div class="tx">Jennings leads the way into the bunkroom. Whitewashed cinder-block walls with one window at either end greet me. It&#8217;s not pretty, but everything on this trip is still something to write home about. Jolene would hate the decor, but it certainly looks easy to clean.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Home, sweet home,&#8221; Patsy Kake says, dropping her sheets and her suitcase onto the last bed in the room, just beneath the far window. The six cots lined up remind me of a hospital room, except for the narrow metal lockers at the foot of each bed.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Everything we own is supposed to go in here?&#8221; someone asks. Nobody answers. I drop my little suitcase by one of the beds. I didn&#8217;t bring much to begin with, but Lowenstein&#8217;s going to need a team of muscle-bound men to help her with those trunks.</div><div class="tx">I take the bed next to Patsy because I&#8217;m standing in front of it. Lowenstein takes the bed to my right.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Howdy, folks,&#8221; Patsy says, turning to face us. &#8220;I&#8217;m Patsy Kake. You can call me Patsy or Cakewalk, whichever you like.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;&#8216;Cakewalk&#8217;? That&#8217;s a funny name,&#8221; Lowenstein says. &#8220;What does it mean?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lowenstein has the most beautiful auburn hair I&#8217;ve ever seen, two shades darker than sunset. It sits in soft waves about her shoulders. Her voice is like women in the movies. It sounds rich. Patsy Kake talks like a barmaid by comparison.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It means I&#8217;m a wing walker in a barnstorming act,&#8221; Patsy says. &#8220;But I can fly, too. With this war and the gas rationing, air shows are all washed up, so I&#8217;m here to be a WASP. I&#8217;m gonna learn how the big boys do it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;A wing walker? Isn&#8217;t that interesting,&#8221; Lowenstein says. &#8220;And dangerous, too. Oh, I&#8217;m Lily Lowenstein.&#8221; She shakes Patsy&#8217;s hand, then turns to me. &#8220;Hello!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hi. I&#8217;m, um, Ida Mae Jones,&#8221; I introduce myself. Lily&#8217;s handshake is friendly, but she must be as nervous as I am. Her hands are ice cold and three shades lighter than mine. &#8220;I&#8217;m Spanish,&#8221; I blurt out Grandy&#8217;s lie for no reason. &#8220;On my mother&#8217;s side.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, Spain&#8217;s wonderful,&#8221; Lily exclaims.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Uh, I&#8217;ve never been.&#8221; I could kick myself. This girl doesn&#8217;t suspect me. I shouldn&#8217;t have jumped the gun like that.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Jonesy and I have already met,&#8221; Patsy says.</div><div class="tx">Down the row of cots, the other girls are making their own introductions. I turn to Patsy and try to change the subject before I say something else stupid. &#8220;Wing walking, you say? I saw a wing walker once at a county fair. It looked pretty scary, even if you like to fly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s easy. I was practically weaned on an airplane  wing. They make you wear a chute, so it&#8217;s perfectly safe, but the crowd loves to see a pretty girl risking her neck for a dollar. I do acrobatics, too, with and without a safety rope. More thrills for your bills that way. Cartwheels and such.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy Kake is a fire engine of a girl. I&#8217;m guessing she&#8217;s only a couple of years older than me, twenty-three at most, and she sounds like she&#8217;s already seen the whole world. I feel my country roots showing, but at least it&#8217;s only that.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What about you, Lowenstein, what&#8217;s your deal?&#8221; Patsy asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she says. She blushes at the sudden attention. A tiny sprinkling of freckles stands out against her flushed skin. &#8220;Well, my . . . my fianc&#233; enlisted as a doctor, but he&#8217;s also a pilot. He taught me how to fly when we were dating. And now that he&#8217;s been shipped overseas . . . Well, I couldn&#8217;t just sit home and do nothing.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Nobody says anything. We all understand. You can only watch so many newsreels before it drives you crazy.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What about you, Jonesy? What&#8217;s your story?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I&#8217;m starting to like the nickname. &#8220;Not much of a story, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Everybody has a story. And it&#8217;s always a doozy. Come on, we&#8217;re all friends here, or at least we will be by the time all of this is over.&#8221; She waves her hand to include the barracks, WASP training, the war. &#8220;I bet I&#8217;ll know your favorite brand of toothpaste inside a week. So we might as well hear the rest of it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m just a farm girl. We grow berries, down in Louisiana. I got my start on my daddy&#8217;s crop duster,&#8221; I add, glad to be able to tell the truth.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And why are you here?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I blink. &#8220;Well, to fly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy laughs, and so does Lily. I find myself laughing with them. When all is said and done, war or no war, patriots or not, it looks like every single girl on this base would drive a thousand miles to nowhere just for the chance to fly.</div><div class="tx">Two cots over, closest to the door, the blonde who answered to Howard nudges the girl settling into the next bunk. &#8220;There goes the neighborhood,&#8221; she says, loud enough for us to hear.</div><div class="tx">The other girl, Laidlaw, I think, smiles politely and finishes making her bed. Howard catches my eye and won&#8217;t let it go. &#8220;Carnies and hicks and Jews, oh my!&#8221; She smirks, imitating Dorothy&#8217;s little chant from <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i> We&#8217;ve all seen the movie. No one else laughs and I ignore the jab. I&#8217;ve met plenty like her before. Lily must&#8217;ve, too, because she smiles at me a little weakly and starts fussing with her suitcase.</div><div class="tx">Patsy, on the other hand, crosses the floorboards in three quick strides. &#8220;And what have we here? Howard, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The girl blanches, almost as pale as her hair. She&#8217;s a strawberry blonde with dramatic red lipstick and blue eye shadow. She probably thinks she looks like Bette Davis. I think it makes her look like Fifinella.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Nancy Howard,&#8221; she says, trying not to stammer. She stands up, a little too late to hold her ground. Patsy towers over her.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Nancy Howard.&#8221; Patsy says the name like she&#8217;s biting it in two. I find myself rising to stand at Patsy&#8217;s elbow. A second later, Lily is next to me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Pleased to met ya, Nancy.&#8221; Patsy holds out her hand. It&#8217;s the strangest showdown I&#8217;ve ever seen, polite on the surface, but like a snakebite underneath. Nancy actually gulps and  looks around. Laidlaw watches from the far side of the bed. No one goes to stand next to Nancy.</div><div class="tx">Patsy&#8217;s hand is still thrust in front of her. Gingerly, Nancy takes it. Her handshake looks like one of those soft, fingertip shakes that the debutantes use in New Orleans. Like holding on to a wet sock. Patsy shakes back, but she shakes like a man, swallowing Nancy&#8217;s little hand whole. Nancy winces and laughs nervously.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Just a joke,&#8221; she says, pulling her hand away. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll all be great friends. Right?&#8221; She looks around with a wildly cheerful smile, then skitters back to her bed against the wall.</div><div class="tx">Laidlaw speaks up. &#8220;I&#8217;m Mary. Pleased to meet you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And I&#8217;m Jeanette,&#8221; the girl named Jennings adds.</div><div class="tx">We smile and exchange genuine pleasantries this time. The tension all but dissipates, and we return to our side of the room. Just like that, the lines are drawn. These two are my new best friends.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Like dogs in a kennel,&#8221; I mutter.</div><div class="tx">Lily giggles a little nervously. Patsy snorts. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got that right, sister. And every one of them female.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, we&#8217;d better get these beds made,&#8221; Patsy continues. &#8220;We all need our beauty sleep.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I snap my sheets in the air and let them float down over the mattress. Grandy always liked a crisply made bed, and I&#8217;m glad that it looks almost, if not quite, military when it&#8217;s done.</div><div class="tx">Patsy finishes her bed when I do, but Lily is a different story.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;How the heck are you supposed to do this?&#8221; she cries into her sheets. She looks like a ghost, covered in linens, and none of them on the bed.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Just toss it over the mattress,&#8221; I say.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you ever made a bed before?&#8221; Patsy asks.</div><div class="tx">Lily falls forward onto the bed, a sheet stretched across her front. &#8220;In case you couldn&#8217;t guess, no, I haven&#8217;t. Greta usually makes my bed. She&#8217;s our housekeeper. I asked her to show me how once, but she refused. She said a proper lady didn&#8217;t have to make her own bed.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;More likely she was afraid she&#8217;d lose her job if you knew how easy it was,&#8221; I say. &#8220;Here, separate your sheets. This is the top, this is the bottom. Just toss it out lightly like this.&#8221; I stand at the foot of the bed and snap the sheet out. It floats down like a blanket of snow.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You make it look so easy.&#8221; Lily blushes. &#8220;I&#8217;m useless.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so hard on yourself, honey.&#8221; Patsy puts an arm around her shoulders.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;If military life was easy, everybody would do it,&#8221; I add.</div><div class="tx">Lily laughs, even though she looks like she&#8217;s about to cry.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Besides,&#8221; I say. &#8220;I&#8217;m practically a professional.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I shake my head. Lily&#8217;s the kind of girl I&#8217;d be cleaning up after back in New Orleans. But now, she&#8217;s giving me a hug for the same kind of work that I usually get paid a dime for. If only Jolene could see me now.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you so much,&#8221; Lily says. &#8220;Here, I know I can do the top sheet if you let me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Give it a go. And tomorrow we&#8217;ll teach you how to dust and do the wash.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy and I laugh, but Lily takes us seriously. &#8220;Do you think you could? Won&#8217;t training take up all of our time?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I should hope so, sister,&#8221; Patsy says.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Why would you want to learn to dust when you can fly?&#8221; I ask her.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, girls, you know we won&#8217;t be in the army forever. When this war is over, Harry and I are getting married. Shouldn&#8217;t a wife know how to cook and clean for her husband?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I never said anything about cooking,&#8221; Patsy says, turning away in mock disgust.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, Mother&#8217;s never taught me a thing about keeping house, but you seem to know what you&#8217;re doing. Ida here can probably even handle an iron. Isn&#8217;t that right, Ida? What if I scorch his shirts?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, brother!&#8221; Patsy exclaims.</div><div class="tx">I sit down on my own bed, suddenly tired. The image of Jolene and me up to our elbows in Otis Wilson&#8217;s dirty socks is hard to swallow. &#8220;Lily&#8217;s right. This war won&#8217;t last forever,&#8221; I say. &#8220;I&#8217;m just hoping that the WASP will.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Amen,&#8221; Patsy says.</div><div class="tx">Lily looks at both of us, a little puzzled, and pulls the sheets tighter on her bed.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Harry will love this,&#8221; she says at last, and pulls a Brownie camera out of her purse to take a picture of the first bed she&#8217;s ever made.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Reveille is at 6 A.M. A bugle plays over the base loudspeakers, cracking the morning silence. I wake up with my eyes sore and dry from the hot Texas air. Still, I&#8217;m up and halfway to the showers before my eyes are even all the way open. Growing up with two brothers and one bathroom, I know sharing two showers with eleven women isn&#8217;t going to be a picnic. I&#8217;m the second person in line, behind Lily Lowenstein.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to get up early,&#8221; she tells me over the hiss of the water. &#8220;But it&#8217;s worth it for all the hot water. I love long showers and baths.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I smile in spite of myself. &#8220;Breakfast is in twenty-five minutes. A short shower will have to do.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily sticks her head out of the shower stall. Her eyes have gone round. &#8220;Oh, of course you&#8217;re right. I&#8217;d better hurry.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I tuck my hair into my shower cap and jump in as soon as she&#8217;s done. We don&#8217;t even cut off the water. It&#8217;s like an assembly line, the ones you see Rosie the Riveter working on in all of the war ads. The thought makes me laugh.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Fifteen minutes!&#8221; someone shouts into the bathroom. I drop my soap, I&#8217;m trying to move so fast.</div><div class="tx">I come out of the shower with my robe already on and race barefoot to my footlocker. The clothes they&#8217;ve given us make us look like we&#8217;re in a chain gang: giant overalls with long sleeves that drag even on the tallest of the girls.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We call them zoot suits,&#8221; the supply officer who handed them out to us explained yesterday. &#8220;You&#8217;ll see why.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">It isn&#8217;t until this morning, pulling the darn thing on, that I get it. Zoot suits, those baggy, wide-legged, tight-ankled outfits all of the hepcats wear in the movies and in some of the dance halls downtown in New Orleans, have nothing on my new jumpsuit. Real zoot suits are all about being oversized, but at least they don&#8217;t drag the ground. I look at the label inside the collar. It&#8217;s too big even for Thomas, and the army says they&#8217;re one size fits all. I shrug and roll up the legs and sleeves, glad that my brothers aren&#8217;t here to laugh at me. Lord only knows what Mama would say. A belt might help keep the crotch above my knees, but it&#8217;s clear I&#8217;m not winning any beauty contests in this getup.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Charming, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; Patsy says to me. Patsy&#8217;s at least four inches taller than my five-foot five. Somehow she makes  the rolled sleeves look smart, and the cuffs are cute instead of utilitarian. I frown and shrug.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;If they&#8217;ll stick me in a plane in this thing, I&#8217;ll wear it,&#8221; I tell her. &#8220;But I hope nobody&#8217;s taking pictures.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy laughs and helps adjust my cuffs.</div><div class="tx">Just then, a woman walks in, ash blond and tanned. She winks at us with green eyes. &#8220;Morning, girls. I&#8217;m your senior squadron leader. I&#8217;m just dropping by to say hello. After breakfast have your group meet me outside of the barracks. I&#8217;ll be talking to the entire class.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; Patsy tells her. I nod silently.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Senior squadron leader.&#8221; I shake my head.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard?&#8221; Patsy asks. &#8220;You&#8217;re in the army now.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We smile at each other and head off to the mess hall. Lily, practically draped in her zoot suit, follows us, one foot barely in each shoe.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">After a breakfast of scrambled eggs and oatmeal, we line up outside of the mess hall. Patsy, Lily, and I stick together automatically. It reminds me of the first day of school. The ash-blonde upperclassman is already there waiting.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Listen up, girls. My name is Audrey Hill. I&#8217;m part of class 43-W-6, and you&#8217;ll be known as 44-W-3. With any luck, we&#8217;ll all graduate before the end of the year. Now, I&#8217;m going to need you to divide into two groups, which we call flights. So, anybody with a last name starting with <i>A</i> through <i>L,</i> move to the left. <i>M</i> to <i>Z,</i> over to the right.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She waves her hands and the cluster of girls parts like the Red Sea. Lily, Patsy, and I stay to the left, and we split up, approximately fifty girls on either side. Audrey counts us and  makes a note on her clipboard, moving her lips and pointing at each girl as she goes.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Fine, then. <i>A</i> through <i>Ls,</i> you&#8217;ll be Flight One, and you others will be Flight Two. Now, I want you all to pick a squadron commander, someone good at organization. She&#8217;ll be in charge of the paperwork and administrative duties for the flight. Then each flight should pick a lieutenant, who will be responsible for getting you into formation after breakfast and marching you properly from class to class.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Keep in mind, this is the military, even if we are civilians. We&#8217;re expected to march and salute just like the rest of the army.&#8221; She smiles mischievously. &#8220;You&#8217;ll learn to love it, girls. We&#8217;ve made it fun.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet they have,&#8221; Patsy says with a smirk.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Patsy, I nominate you for squadron commander,&#8221; Lily says brightly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got stage . . . or, I guess, wing experience, and you&#8217;re tall, so people will notice you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, no, sister, I&#8217;m not leadership material,&#8221; Patsy says, putting a defensive hand in the air. &#8220;I&#8217;m just here to fly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Then you do it, Red,&#8221; another girl says to Lily. Lily blushes instantly, living up to the nickname originally aimed at her auburn hair.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t possibly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I bet you could,&#8221; I chime in. &#8220;Think of how proud Harry would be.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily beams in spite of herself. &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll do it . . . that is, if nobody has any objections.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Anybody got a problem with Lowenstein doing the paperwork?&#8221; Patsy asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; somebody says. &#8220;If I wanted to be a secretary, I&#8217;d have stayed at home.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily flushes. &#8220;Is it really just secretarial work?&#8221; she asks Audrey.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, dear. It&#8217;s an important position. And just the fact that you&#8217;ve stepped up to the plate when these other ladies think they&#8217;re too good for the job means you&#8217;ve got a better shot at becoming a WASP than any of them.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily beams all over again. &#8220;Did you hear that? I&#8217;ve got a shot!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;ll be flight lieutenant,&#8221; I say quickly. Anything to give me a leg up is a good thing. I wish I&#8217;d thought of it sooner.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Fine,&#8221; Audrey says. &#8220;And the other flight?&#8221; A girl named Janet Raines takes the other position. Patsy smiles at me, apparently satisfied at dodging the leadership bullet.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, then, lieutenants, gather your girls into line, marching two abreast, and I&#8217;ll show you around.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Janet and I step forward, next to Audrey. &#8220;What do we do?&#8221; I ask softly, so the others won&#8217;t hear.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, just say, &#8216;Attention!&#8217; and they should fall into place.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Do they know that?&#8221; Janet asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, for heaven&#8217;s sake!&#8221; Audrey shakes her head at us. &#8220;Ladies, when they say &#8216;attention,&#8217; line up like I asked.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Atten-shun!&#8221; I shout as loud as I can. Lily jumps, startled. Patsy fights to keep from laughing. But it works, and my flight lines up, two women abreast, twenty-four rows deep.</div><div class="tx">Janet follows suit, and soon we look like the real thing, lined up and ready to march.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Come on, girls. I&#8217;ll teach you a few of the camp songs along the way,&#8221; Audrey says. She turns on her heel and heads off across the base yard.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Uh, forward, march!&#8221; I say, remembering the line from a  movie. It works as well as &#8220;attention&#8221; did, and we tramp after Audrey in the yellow Texas dust.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sing after me,&#8221; Audrey calls out.</div><div class="atx1"><div class="ctag1"><i>&#8220;Once we wore scanties, now we&#8217;re in zoots.</i>  <br></br><i>They are our issue GI flying suits.</i>  <br></br><i>They come in all sizes, large, Large, and LARGE.</i>  <br></br><i>We look like a great big barge.&#8221;</i></div></div><div class="tx">We&#8217;re all still laughing at the song when we pass the hangars and come to the low building where our classes will be held.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;In addition to the classrooms, the pilot ready room is here. That&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll suit up and wait your turn to fly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I break into a grin. &#8220;That&#8217;s the first time anybody&#8217;s actually said we&#8217;re going to fly,&#8221; I whisper to Patsy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t pinch me, I don&#8217;t want to wake up.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No kidding,&#8221; Patsy agrees. We follow Lily and the rest of the flight behind Audrey, across the yard to the actual landing field. The field itself reminds me of Airline Highway in Slidell, fifty miles of straight, unbending pavement, but instead of pickup trucks and fruit wagons, Avenger Field is dotted with airplanes, primary trainers, and advanced trainers, open and closed cockpit. I stop in my tracks, watching as girls like me take off and land. My chest feels so full I think I&#8217;m going to explode. I want to run down the middle of that airfield and jump right up into the air myself.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hill, what are you bringing out on my tarmac?&#8221; a man&#8217;s voice asks. There&#8217;s that Texas twang, so different from my own slow New Orleans brogue. I pull my eyes off the runway long enough to see who interrupted our voyeuristic bliss.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ladies, I&#8217;d like you to meet Sergeant Middleton. He&#8217;s the head engineer who works on all of our planes.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Middleton gives us a dubious once-over. He&#8217;s youngish, probably not even thirty, but the way he squints at us, and with his short-cropped strawberry blond hair making him look almost bald, from a distance I&#8217;d have probably guessed he was a lot older. He reminds me of that cartoon fellow, Pop-eye, but in an army uniform instead of a sailor suit.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Forty-four double-U three?&#8221; he says with as much doubt as his hard squint implies. He shakes his head, and I half expect him to spit, he looks so disappointed.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, just keep them off my airfield until they&#8217;re properly suited and trained. I don&#8217;t want to see none of you out heres without an instructor,&#8221; he says, pointing a thick finger. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t no beauty parlor. And it ain&#8217;t the movies, neither, so quit gawking. You&#8217;ll get your turns soon enough.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He shakes his head again and runs a hand over his crew cut. &#8220;Ma&#8217;am.&#8221; He nods toward Audrey and shuffles off toward the hangars.</div><div class="tx">Audrey smiles and shrugs. &#8220;Damn fine engineer, but not much for the niceties. It&#8217;s best to stay on his good side, though, ladies. He keeps us up in the air. Our lives depend on Sergeant Middleton.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Aye aye,&#8221; Lily says with a sharp salute.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Aye aye is the navy,&#8221; I whisper from behind.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, cripes.&#8221; She lowers her hand quickly. Audrey Hill just smiles and continues the tour.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Just a few more things. When you fly, or anytime you&#8217;re near the planes, you&#8217;ll have to wear those turbans they gave you with your flight suits. You know, the thing that looks like a towel? Despite Sergeant Middleton&#8217;s insistence that  this &#8216;ain&#8217;t no beauty parlor,&#8217; we have to keep our hair from getting caught in any machinery. We have our commanding officer, Major Urban, to thank for that, so we call them &#8216;Urban&#8217;s turbans.&#8217; Kinda catchy, huh?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Most of the girls laugh, but a few sigh and primp their perfectly coiffed tresses. I for one would much rather slap my hair into braids and stick it in a towel than have to worry that it&#8217;s getting too kinky. Thank you, Major Urban, I think.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;So, that&#8217;s about it. You&#8217;ll figure out the rest as you go along. Once again, as your squadron leader, if you have any questions, just come to me. I&#8217;m over in Barrack Seven.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Audrey leads us back to our barracks. &#8220;At thirteen hundred hours, you should all report to the medical unit. Doc Monserud needs to perform a complete physical workup for each of you and get your dental records in order in case they&#8217;re needed for identification later.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Identification?&#8221; one of the girls asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, identification.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">There&#8217;s a moment of confused silence. Patsy scowls at the girl. &#8220;In case we get burned up in a crash. They&#8217;ll know you by your overbite.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The girl&#8217;s eyes go round as moons. &#8220;Oh.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Audrey frowns at Patsy, who smiles back pleasantly.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Patsy,&#8221; I whisper, more than a little shocked myself.</div><div class="tx">Patsy just shrugs. Audrey smiles at the poor girl. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, honey, we hardly ever need them. Hardly ever.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">With that, she salutes and walks away.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That didn&#8217;t sound enough like &#8216;never&#8217; to me,&#8221; Patsy says, and winks.</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s my turn to shrug. &#8220;We&#8217;ll worry about it when we have  to. But now, I&#8217;m going to get five more minutes of shut-eye before we have to go see the doctor.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hear, hear.&#8221; Patsy yawns. &#8220;Getting up at dawn wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if it meant we were flying. But today&#8217;s a bust.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Fact is, I need the time to try to relax. In the South, folks think skin color shows up in the blood. If that&#8217;s true, Doctor Monserud will have me on the next bus out of town. My big brother, Thomas, swore to me after his first year of medical school that it just wasn&#8217;t true. Skin color is only in the skin, he said. I believe him, but today&#8217;s physical had better prove him right. I don&#8217;t know if they can tell the difference between Spanish and Negro when it comes to blood tests, so Grandy&#8217;s advice might not work.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">The day goes from bust to worse, but not in any way I feared. By the time Doctor Monserud is done with us, we&#8217;ve been poked and prodded with so many different needles and vaccines, I feel like a sick porcupine. But I passed the test, in more ways than one. Good old Thomas really is learning something in medical school.</div><div class="tx">At last, it&#8217;s suppertime. I don&#8217;t think I can keep anything down, but I know I won&#8217;t get another chance until morning.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Jumpin&#8217; Jehoshaphat,&#8221; I say the minute we walk into the mess hall. Most of the other classes are already there, women sitting on one side of the room, male officers and instructors on the other side. But it&#8217;s not the people that stop me in my tracks.</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s the food on the first plate in front of me. A man is sitting there, eating a steak, casual as day, and a baked potato heaped with pure, sweet, pale creamery butter.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Pinch me, Patsy. I haven&#8217;t seen butter in eight months.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy slaps me on the arm lightly. &#8220;What, don&#8217;t you have cows on that farm of yours?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s a berry farm. No. We&#8217;ve got all the jams and jellies you can eat, but not a single stick of real butter.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily remains conspicuously silent for a whole half a minute. &#8220;Okay, okay. We had butter at my parents&#8217; place in the Adirondacks. The caretakers brought in a cow specially for us to have butter, milk, and cheese.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, for those of us born without a silver butter knife in our mouths, make way,&#8221; Patsy says, and shoves herself through to the food line.</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s like some kind of Hansel and Gretel fairy tale in here. Nothing at breakfast prepared me for this sort of spread. Steak, real sugar, even ice cream, and not a ration stamp in sight. If Mama and Jolene had known what the food was like, they might have signed up, too. I find my appetite quickly enough when it comes to dessert. I go to bed that night happier than I&#8217;ve been in a long time, with a stomach full of food and my head full of tomorrow&#8217;s first flight.</div></body></html>';

All twelve of us are up early. Today is the day we fly. Lily times us, five-minute showers each. Even so, the last girl out has no time to worry about makeup or hair; she just yanks her zoot suit on and races outside with the rest of us. Fortunately, Uncle Sam doesn&#8217;t care about lipstick or perfectly curled hair. Only the first few girls out of the shower can afford to primp. Dolled up or not, our whole bay makes it through the showers and outside in time for formation and roll call. Patsy and I make sure our classmates line up outside the barracks into our separate flights. I stand next to Patsy and watch Lily call out the roll in a high, nervous voice. She catches my eye and I give her a thumbs-up. She smiles and leads us to the mess hall for breakfast.</div><div class="tx">An hour later, we are back in the barracks, trying to finish what we started in the bathrooms before breakfast. At eight forty-five, Lily leads our flight, zoot suited and Urban turbaned, out to the cattle trucks that will take us to our first day of flying.</div><div class="tx">The trucks are what they call stake beds, large, flatbed trucks with wooden slats, almost like a fence, to keep the animals in. We stand in back and get towed three miles to one of the auxiliary fields where new classes begin their training. The ready room at this field is nothing more than a Quonset hut, a low-slung arch of a building with a tin roof that touches  the ground on both sides. It looks more like a tunnel than a building. Inside, benches are lined up against a blackboard, scribbled with the flight calculations of other pilots. Lily, Patsy, and I stick together. We take seats and wait, like a bunch of first graders on the first day of school. I almost wish I had an apple for the teacher.</div><div class="tx">At oh-nine-hundred precisely, our instructor arrives. He&#8217;s a civilian, and his name is Happy Martin. &#8220;You may call me &#8216;sir,&#8217; &#8216;Instructor Martin,&#8217; or &#8216;Mr. Martin.&#8217; Neither I nor the majority of your flight instructors are enlisted. That, however, does not mean we do not deserve your respect.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You&#8217;ve left husbands and children at home to be here, and while I can&#8217;t approve of that choice, I can make sure that you still know your place in this man&#8217;s army.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">A murmur of disapproval sweeps across the room, not so much sounds of protest as a shifting of bodies in seats. I am reminded of the flight instructor back in Tuskegee. There are no steel blue eyes here, no strong, disapproving jawline. On the contrary, Instructor Martin is a very prim-looking fellow, black hair carefully combed back, not a strand out of place. He is wearing a khaki shirt and matching slacks, despite his insistence that he is not military. His black-rimmed glasses are the only square thing on his round face. He looks like an insurance salesman. It takes me a full minute to believe this man has ever flown in his life. Anybody whose feet have ever left this green earth should have something wild about them, something free. One look at Instructor Martin and I&#8217;m pretty sure that military or no, he spit-shines his shoes and his wife presses the crease into his pants precisely the same way every single day.</div><div class="tx">The moment of tension passes, ignored by the teacher but  well noted by the students. I look at Patsy, fully expecting her to stand up to Martin the way she did Nancy Howard. Instead, she&#8217;s examining her fingernails as if it&#8217;s a casual day at the beach. To my right, Lily clenches her jaw in defiance. We&#8217;ll show him, she seems to say. I raise my own chin a little higher.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now, because you&#8217;ll be sharing parachutes, I&#8217;ll need you to split up into groups according to height. Anyone below five-foot five over here, five-foot sixes and sevens to this side, eights to nines, and so forth. Although I doubt we&#8217;ll be getting anyone taller than that.&#8221; He laughs at his own humor. A few of the girls feel obliged to join in.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;See you on the ground,&#8221; I say to Patsy. She&#8217;s definitely in the five-eight, five-nine range, while Lily and I are firmly in the five-two to five-foot five.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Good luck, flygirl,&#8221; she tells me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Good luck.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The parachutes they give us attach to our torsos with thick olive drab harnesses that go over the shoulders and around the legs. Our zoot suits bag out over them unmercifully, but you could have told me I had to wear iron shoes and I&#8217;d still be smiling. I&#8217;m about to fly.</div><div class="tx">Instructor Martin walks us through the use of the chutes&#8212;how to pull the rip cord, how to fold up the silks afterward. Feeling the smooth cloth under my fingers makes me think of Jolene&#8217;s prized silk stockings, reluctantly turned over to the army back home. I guess she did help the war effort after all.</div><div class="tx">Parachutes in place, Instructor Martin leads the first group of girls, those of us in the five-foot-five-and-under crowd, out to the tarmac. The rest of the girls are supposed to wait in  the ready room for their turn, but they rush to the door to watch us.</div><div class="tx">The plane waiting for us on the tarmac is an absolute beauty. To my farm-raised eyes, those silver wings and open cockpit are like a dream, but some of the girls groan slightly.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ladies, this is the PT-19A, a primary trainer. By the time this course is done, you will have completed fifty-five hours in this plane. You will be able to fuel her, repair her, and land her in the event of an accident. I know this all sounds routine to such an accomplished lot of pilots&#8221;&#8212;he makes no attempt to hide his sarcasm&#8212;&#8220;but Sunday flying with your beau and actually flying the military way are two different things. These planes are heavier than the Jennys and Pipers you flew at home, and there will be no one here to hold your hand. Having said that, do we have a volunteer?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Every hand in the group goes up, mine included. Instructor Martin smirks, as if he knew this would happen. &#8220;Not a cautious one of you in the lot,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;Very well, we&#8217;ll make this easy. You, what is your name?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily, the first in line to his left, steps forward, face pale, with two red spots on her cheeks. I can&#8217;t tell if she&#8217;s excited or terrified, but I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s both.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Lily Lowenstein, sir.&#8221; Martin raises an eyebrow at the name. And I thought I&#8217;d have it hard.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, Lily Lowenstein.&#8221; He makes the name sound long and round. &#8220;You have your flight suit, your parachute, and your goggles?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; she says nervously.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, then, put the goggles on and get in.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily hesitates. I want to whisper to her, tell her it&#8217;s a trap, but I don&#8217;t need to.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We haven&#8217;t run a flight check yet, sir. We should go over the plane first.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Happy Martin doesn&#8217;t look happy. She&#8217;s just robbed him of a chance to make her look like a fool. I try not to smile too broadly. Lily knows her stuff. After watching her try to make a bed, I hadn&#8217;t been so sure.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ah, so someone actually did pay attention in flight school,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Miss Lowenstein, lead the way.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Only after giving the plane a thorough once-over does Lily climb in, with Instructor Martin behind her. The PT-19A has an open cockpit with two controls, one in the front, the other in back. Instructor Martin takes the rear seat. He radios the tower for clearance and, without warning, starts down the runway. Lily gives me a quick thumbs-up, and they take off, Martin at the controls. We won&#8217;t be allowed to take off or land until he&#8217;s confident we can handle the plane through all the basic maneuvers every pilot here should know.</div><div class="tx">All of the girls, even the ones in the ready room, line up on the tarmac to watch Lily&#8217;s first flight. The plane banks and turns. It&#8217;s a beautiful sight to see in the clear blue Texas sky. Then, suddenly, the plane does a loop in the air, and something awful happens. Lily falls out of the plane! A tiny figure, still visible in her oversized zoot suit, slips from the backseat and plummets toward the earth.</div><div class="tx">We all cry out. My legs start moving before I can think. Patsy, the entire class starts to run, our eyes on the sky. A second later, the parachute balloons out behind her, and we all heave a sigh of relief.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,&#8221; Patsy mutters.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Amen,&#8221; I add. Silently, I say thank you to Jolene, too. We jog the rest of the way across the fields to the spot  where Lily has drifted gently to earth. When we get there, she is crying.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Honey, are you hurt?&#8221; Patsy kneels beside her.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No,&#8221; she sobs.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Are you sure? Can you stand?&#8221; I give her a hand and we help pull her to her feet.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Is she all right?&#8221; the other girls ask, running toward us, breathless.</div><div class="tx">Lily&#8217;s face, already red from crying, turns an even deeper red. &#8220;Oh, no, I&#8217;m fine. I&#8217;m okay.&#8221; She gives them a weak thumbs-up. A cheer goes up. But Lily turns away.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m so embarrassed, I could die.&#8221; She begins to pace in little circles.</div><div class="tx">I put my arm around her shoulders. Patsy begins to gather her parachute. &#8220;Well, what happened?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily stops her pacing and gives me an anguished look. &#8220;Oh, Ida, I swear I fastened my seat belt, but this darn suit is so big, it got in the way and I guess the belt didn&#8217;t lock properly. I should&#8217;ve double-checked it, but it felt right, and we took off so fast, and he was saying, &#8216;Look at this,&#8217; and, &#8216;Don&#8217;t forget that,&#8217; and then he says, &#8220;Do a loop,&#8221; like he doesn&#8217;t think I can, and next thing I know, I&#8217;m pulling my rip cord. And I&#8217;d been so careful, too!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Lily. It&#8217;s just the first day. And that&#8217;s one mistake you&#8217;ll never make again.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Aw, honey, it&#8217;s a rite of passage,&#8221; Patsy says. &#8220;You&#8217;ve joined the Caterpillar Club!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Caterpillar Club?&#8221; Lily asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s what they call it when you use your parachute. It opens like a silk cocoon. You&#8217;ve just spread your wings, little butterfly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We sent the warning to all the girls in Flight One. Don&#8217;t forget to double-check your seat belt. No one else wants to be a member of the club today.</div><div class="tx">By the time we get back to the flight line, Instructor Martin has landed. &#8220;Any broken limbs?&#8221; he calls out to Lily.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, sir.&#8221; Lily blushes three shades of pink and I feel just awful for her, but at least he&#8217;s not giving her a demerit.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Fortunately, Miss Lowenstein remembered her parachute, if not her seat belt,&#8221; he says to the class. Lily starts to protest, but I put a hand on her arm to stop her. Falling out of your plane doesn&#8217;t earn you a demerit today, but arguing with the instructor just might.</div><div class="tx">Martin clasps his little hands together with a smug look and says, &#8220;The kitchen is safer than the sky, ladies. Let that be a lesson to you. Next?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily bristles, but I have no time to commiserate. I&#8217;m up.</div><div class="tx">My hands start to sweat. This is the first time I&#8217;ve done more than sit in a plane since Tuskegee, three years ago, and it looks like Instructor Martin is determined to make it hard. Then again, this is what I&#8217;ve come here for.</div><div class="tx">I give the plane a once-over and climb on board. This plane is not too different from my daddy&#8217;s plane. The same sort of open cockpit, tandem seats for pilot and co-pilot. It&#8217;s just like going up on a dusting run with Grandy sitting ahead of me. With that thought, all of the butterflies fade away. It&#8217;s like a cool wind is blowing through my mind. I smile. Settling into the frontseat, I make doubly sure I fasten my seat belt before I look over the instruments and put my hand on the throttle.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hands off until we&#8217;re in the air,&#8221; Martin shouts at me. His voice comes through the gosport, a speaking tube that runs from his dashboard to my helmet like a one-way telephone.  I nod. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what to do and when.&#8221; I nod again and sit back. Martin can do what he will; I aim to enjoy myself.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;This is Flight One PT-19A signaling for takeoff,&#8221; Martin says into the radio.</div><div class="tx">After a brief moment, the radio crackles to life. &#8220;This is the tower,&#8221; a man&#8217;s voice says. &#8220;PT-19A, you are cleared for takeoff.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Miss Jones, note the clearance light on the tower and the pattern of the flight and to your left, the wind sock on the hangar. Note the direction of the wind.&#8221; And the sun and the moon and the cows in the fields, I think. I will not be distracted. I checked the wind and the clouds the minute we got into the plane. Nothing to get in our way. With a hum of engine and tires, we roll up the runway and leap into flight.</div><div class="tx">The wind snaps around my ears, tugging at my turban and my goggles, burning my face with its speed. I want to laugh. I want to spread my arms into the clear blue sky and soar toward the sun. We climb higher and higher, and suddenly, the plane dips.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You have the controls, Miss Jones.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My hand falls onto the stick easily, and I pull us level. The instructor told the truth: this plane does not respond as easily as my father&#8217;s JN-4. But it does respond. We ride the air and I think of Daddy. This is exactly where I want to be.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Let&#8217;s begin with an easy turn. Bank right.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I follow his orders and guide the plane into a smooth turn, first right, then left, up and down as he commands. The wind flows over her wings like ice cream, smooth and sweet.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Release,&#8221; he says through the tube, and I reluctantly let go of the stick. I can feel him take over and realize a second  before he does it that he is throwing us into a loop. I can&#8217;t help myself, I throw my hands into the air with complete and utter glee. Upside down, I can see Avenger and the other auxiliary fields dotting the flat, sandy landscape like raisins in a piece of bread.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Parachute!&#8221; Instructor Martin yells at me. He thinks I&#8217;m falling out of the plane. And then it sinks in&#8212;the old codger is trying to dump me! Lily didn&#8217;t have an accident after all. &#8220;The kitchen is safer than the sky,&#8221; my foot. I snort and bring my hands back in. Martin pulls the plane level and brings us in for a landing.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s not proper decorum for a military pilot, Miss Jones,&#8221; he warns me. I can hear the disappointment in his voice. &#8220;Or for a young lady,&#8221; he adds.</div><div class="tx">Or for an instructor, I think. Regardless, when we come in for a landing, part of me is still flying high.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">&#8220;How many girls is he going to try to dump before he realizes we&#8217;ve learned our lesson?&#8221; I ask Patsy as she steps up the flight line. &#8220;He should be court-martialed for this. Trying to scare us into quitting. It&#8217;s practically attempted murder!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She shakes her head. &#8220;Like any of the girls here would turn him in on the first day of flight school. Nobody&#8217;d take the word of a brand new trainee over an instructor&#8217;s, and don&#8217;t think he doesn&#8217;t know it.&#8221; She scowls at Martin, who stands smugly beside the plane, waiting for his next victim. &#8220;But don&#8217;t you worry, I&#8217;ve got a fix for Mr. Happy,&#8221; she says, &#8220;and he&#8217;ll swallow it, or I&#8217;ll turn him in myself.&#8221; She throws me a wink and strides toward the plane with a smirk to match the instructor&#8217;s.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Lily, come watch this.&#8221; I call her away from her parachute, which she has been worrying over ever since her awkward landing. Of the bunch, she&#8217;s the only one Martin managed to actually dump, especially since she was the one doing the flying. Sure, he tried to surprise the rest of us by taking the controls over himself, but you&#8217;ve only got to see a girl fall out of a plane once to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen to you. Poor Lily. I hope Patsy pays Martin back a hundredfold. She is the last one to go up today, and everyone comes out to watch her.</div><div class="tx">Happy sends her into the usual banks and turns, but on the loop, something remarkable happens. At the top of the loop, upside down, Patsy drops out of the plane&#8212;but she does not fall. She holds on to the plane with both hands, doing what looks like a handstand, only she&#8217;s standing right-side up with the plane over her. My heart skips a beat.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;She&#8217;ll be killed!&#8221; Lily screams.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, she&#8217;s a wing walker, remember? Cakewalk Kake?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;But she doesn&#8217;t even have a . . . rope or anything!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">One of the other girls steps forward, shielding her eyes for a better view. &#8220;Way I hear it, they didn&#8217;t even wear parachutes until &#8217;38.&#8221; She grins. &#8220;Hotdog. She&#8217;s just out there. Look at her go.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily falls silent, but she doesn&#8217;t relax until Patsy flips herself back into the plane just as it comes level again. When Patsy pays somebody back, she sure does it with style.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Can&#8217;t you just hear him screaming at her?&#8221; I ask, a broad grin spreading across my face. &#8220;Miss Kake, that is not proper decorum for a lady!&#8221; I mimic the instructor&#8217;s prim voice.</div><div class="tx">The other girls laugh, even Lily, reluctantly. &#8220;I suppose, though, I&#8217;ll have to give her a demerit for that.&#8221; She looks  suddenly crestfallen. &#8220;What if she washes out for this?&#8221; Everyone else sobers up fast.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh no, she won&#8217;t,&#8221; I tell her quickly. &#8220;He deserved a scare for what he did to you. And he won&#8217;t dare punish her&#8212;she&#8217;ll turn him in if he does, even if it&#8217;s a trainee&#8217;s word against his. I&#8217;ll back her up if it comes to that. But for now, we didn&#8217;t see anything. Let&#8217;s get back to the ready room. I doubt he&#8217;ll even mention it. He&#8217;ll be too embarrassed.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We bustle back to the ready room as quickly as we can. No one stays outside to see Patsy&#8217;s triumphant return to earth.</div><div class="tx">She walks into the room a few minutes later, eyes shining. She gives us a curious look. I wink at her. She smiles. &#8220;The old buzzard gave me two demerits, but it was worth it,&#8221; she announces. &#8220;He&#8217;ll never pull that stunt again.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, Patsy, that&#8217;s terrible!&#8221; Lily exclaims. &#8220;Maybe we should report him.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy shrugs. &#8220;Do you want to go to court, or do you want to fly?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The rest of us remain silent. We&#8217;re pilots and we want to stay, no matter what. I squeeze Patsy&#8217;s hand. A second later, a very flustered Instructor Martin enters the room.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, ladies, that will be all for today. This afternoon you have physical instruction back at the base. And I&#8217;ll see you in the morning.&#8221; He doesn&#8217;t so much as look at us once. We all stare daggers at him, except for Patsy, who demurely lowers her eyes, trying not to smile.</div><div class="tx">Instructor Martin clears his throat and busies himself with his papers.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Dismissed.&#8221;</div></body></html>';

The lake was a dangerous place to be, with an undertow that grabbed on tight and pulled you down. More than a few children have drowned there. Grown-ups, too. But it&#8217;s where colored people go to swim. The safer beaches are &#8220;whites only.&#8221; Of the five of us there, only Daddy really knew how to handle the water. He knew to stay near the shore, away from the worst of the currents. Me, I had never been in anything deeper than a bathtub, and that not even full to the top. I stared at that dark blue water so long that it wasn&#8217;t blue anymore, but black. And cold. It must&#8217;ve been August for us to want to go swimming, but I wasn&#8217;t having any of it. While the boys ran toward the water, I hung back, hugging myself with skinny, goose-pimpled arms.</div><div class="tx">Thomas was the one to push me in, or one of his friends. Afterward, none of them would say who&#8217;d done it. Who had shoved me screaming to cut through the black skin of the lake like a knife. I didn&#8217;t float, didn&#8217;t paddle. I simply sank, dragged down by the undercurrent. Daddy pulled me free with one hand and smacked my back until I coughed up half a cup of water, and that was it. I never wanted to swim again.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Old Clayfoot, sunk like a ton of bricks,&#8221; Daddy said. But he hugged me close. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Little Bit. You&#8217;re all right. When you&#8217;re ready, we&#8217;ll go in again. This time, without help  from those rascals.&#8221; He scowled at Thomas and his two buddies. All three looked about ready to cry.</div><div class="tx">I pressed into my daddy&#8217;s chest and shook my head. &#8220;Uh-uh,&#8221; was all I said. And that was that. Daddy didn&#8217;t push me. Later, he&#8217;d say it was the look on my face that told him not to. Said I looked like I&#8217;d seen the devil under the water, waving at me. Maybe I had. All I know is I didn&#8217;t go back to Pontchartrain until high school, and from then on, I stayed on the shore. That was fine. All the girls did. It was more about swimsuits than swimming, anyway.</div><div class="tx">Not like today. Today, we&#8217;re having a swim test. We&#8217;re lined up, two by two, like Noah&#8217;s Ark at the Sweetwater Municipal pool. It&#8217;s closed to looky-loos, thank goodness, and I&#8217;m at the back of the line. I made sure of that. My hair is braided tight against frizzing, but that&#8217;s the least of my worries.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;One lap, ladies, one lap fully clothed in your flight suits,&#8221; Doc Monserud shouts across the pool to our flight. &#8220;Something you should get used to. In case of a water landing.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Right, water landing,&#8221; Patsy says, two girls ahead of me. &#8220;In case the plane decides to float.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t jinx it,&#8221; someone else says. Patsy looks over her shoulder at me and winks. I don&#8217;t wink back. I can barely take my eyes off the pool.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look too bad,&#8221; Lily says. &#8220;Why, the pool in my apartment building is twice this size. A real Olympic regulation swimming pool.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Fancy,&#8221; Patsy drawls. She turns to me. &#8220;What&#8217;s a matter, honey?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I grit my teeth. &#8220;Nothing. I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Like heck. What is it?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I stare at my feet. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m going to wash out before basic training has even really begun. I can feel Patsy looking at me. I return the look with watery eyes.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I can&#8217;t swim.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The girls near us start to cluck their tongues and shake their heads. &#8220;Poor kid.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s a shame.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Stop your gobbling,&#8221; Patsy says to them. &#8220;Look, Jonesy. You handle yourself pretty well in the sky. We&#8217;ll figure something out.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I could swim for her,&#8221; Lily whispers.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What? How?&#8221; I stare at her, hating to hope there is a way.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sorry, sister, but you two don&#8217;t look a thing alike, aside from height, that is.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Not with my hair down,&#8221; Lily says. &#8220;But look at them in there.&#8221; She points with her chin to the first of the swimmers. They struggle through the water in their overgrown man suits, hair wrapped up in Urban&#8217;s ugly old turbans. If I didn&#8217;t know better, I&#8217;d say they just want to drown us all.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;She&#8217;s right,&#8221; Patsy says. &#8220;Bundled up in that mess, you couldn&#8217;t tell if it was a man or a woman, let alone which woman.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You&#8217;d do this for me?&#8221; I take Lily by the arm. If she&#8217;s caught, we&#8217;ll both get thrown out. Lily&#8217;s eyes waver, but only for a second. She sets her jaw and nods at me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;For the woman that taught me how to make a bed, I&#8217;d do anything.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We&#8217;re at the front of the line now. I hang back and let the other women pass me. Lily jumps in, alongside Patsy.</div><div class="tx">They sink a little, then float back up to the top of the pool.  Their clothes are another matter. The zoot suits are like anchors. My heart flutters in my throat just watching them, and I know that I could never do what Lily is doing for me. There are a lot of things I can handle, but water isn&#8217;t one of them.</div><div class="tx">After what seems like a dog&#8217;s age, Lily makes it to the other side of the pool. Doc Monserud is so busy with the other girls, I break free from the group and meet up with Lily and a towel. Patsy climbs out of the pool, grabs another towel, and holds it up as a curtain for both of us. The other girls are too busy with their zoot suits and turbans and pure exhaustion to even notice Lily and me changing suits.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Are you sure you can do this?&#8221; I whisper.</div><div class="tx">Lily gasps. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me again, Ida. I don&#8217;t have the breath to say yes.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She dresses more quickly than I do, thanks to my dry suit. But a wet zoot suit is a horse of a different color. I struggle halfway into it before Patsy stops me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hey, kiddo, look around,&#8221; she says softly. Every girl that&#8217;s finished the swim is half out of her suit and half into a towel. Patsy smiles. &#8220;As far as they know, you&#8217;re done. Just wrap up in a towel now and watch Johnny Weissmuller over there strut her stuff.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I have to laugh at that. Buster Crabbe may be a matinee idol now, but once upon a time he was an Olympic swim champion. I pull the towel around me gratefully and turn to watch Lily catch up with the end of the line. When the doc blows the whistle, she jumps right in without looking at him.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;She sure can swim,&#8221; Patsy says.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;She&#8217;s a regular Tarzan,&#8221; I say, referring to Johnny Weissmuller&#8217;s most famous role.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Heck, no,&#8221; Patsy says. &#8220;Tarzan never had to wear a zoot suit. Our Lily is a Jane all the way.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily climbs out of the pool for the second time. She looks tiny in the waterlogged suit but elated.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I think we did it,&#8221; she says, waving her hands excitedly.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Keep it down,&#8221; Patsy tells her, and tosses a dry towel over her head.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you, Lily. You saved my skin.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily grins back happily. &#8220;If it weren&#8217;t for all this deadweight, it would&#8217;ve almost been fun.&#8221;</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">After the swim test is complete, we&#8217;re bussed back to the base where Doc Monserud dismisses us. Not all of Flight One has passed. Two girls, Anderson and Shaw, are told to report to Deatie Deaton&#8217;s office after they shower. The girls head to the showers, chattering about the difficulty of swimming in clothes or, worse, what a wet turban feels like in the Texas heat. It&#8217;s hot enough to make our clothes steam, but not to dry them.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to clean up?&#8221; Patsy asks me. &#8220;We&#8217;re due at the mess hall in fifteen minutes.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I&#8217;m slumped against the wall outside the showers in Lily&#8217;s wet zoot suit. I feel ashamed. Two of us have already washed out. I&#8217;m still here only because I cheated. I&#8217;ve already lied about my license and my race. What else will I do before this training is done?</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m fine,&#8221; I finally say. &#8220;But I guess I should report to Mrs. Deaton as a washout.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy stops toweling her hair and gives me a look. &#8220;Now, Jonesy, don&#8217;t let this eat at you. You think those kids overseas get along all by their lonesome in this war? Of course not.  We&#8217;re a team. We shoulder each other. Anderson and Shaw should&#8217;ve been half as clever as you to figure that out.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I give her a weak smile, but I still feel wrong.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida Mae, hurry up,&#8221; Lily calls out from the dormitory. She&#8217;s already back in her khakis, lacing up her shoes. &#8220;I&#8217;ll save you two a seat at the mess.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thanks, Lily,&#8221; Patsy says for both of us. After Lily leaves, Patsy takes me by the wrist. &#8220;Listen, Jones. Lily went out on a limb for you. The least you could do is be grateful. Happy, even.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I don&#8217;t meet her eyes. &#8220;The thing is, I&#8217;m more grateful than I can say.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy smiles and lets go of my wrist. &#8220;Then don&#8217;t say anything. And repay the favor when you can.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">At last I smile. Lily and Patsy aren&#8217;t just my classmates, they are real friends. Maybe it&#8217;s not the same as it is with me and Jolene&#8212;they don&#8217;t know everything about Ida Mae Jones. But they know Jonesy, and that&#8217;s who I really am. For the first time since leaving home, I&#8217;ve got friends, and that tells me I belong.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Dinner is a somber affair as everyone says goodbye to Anderson and Shaw. We&#8217;ve been together only a short while, but seeing two of our own wash out brings everyone down. I hang back, feeling guilty that I&#8217;m not leaving, too, but more desperate than ever to stay. After the two girls say their goodbyes, the mood changes and the pressure of training takes over. We linger after dinner comparing class notes, especially in navigation. Reading maps is second nature for some but not all of the WASP. I chatter along with the rest of the girls, and we stay up until lights-out studying flight maps and practicing  plotting courses. But afterward, when the lights go off, I lie awake and think of Lake Pontchartrain and how fear, any fear, can be my enemy.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Shoo, fly, don&#8217;t bother me. Shoo, fly, don&#8217;t bother me,&#8221; I tell myself. I&#8217;ll get over my fear one day. I have to. Anything else and I&#8217;d be less than a WASP.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Lily.&#8221; I am across the room and standing by her bed before I can stop myself. &#8220;Lily, are you awake?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily moans. Her head is completely under the covers.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, Mother. I&#8217;ll be right there,&#8221; she says sleepily.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Lily.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Her head pops out of the blankets, red hair wrapped in a sleeping turban, like the high-society version of Urban&#8217;s finest.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida, what is it? Is everything okay?&#8221; Her brown eyes are wide.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sorry to wake you. It&#8217;s just . . .&#8221; I sit on the edge of her bed and reach for the right words. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s like making a bed. I mean, I&#8217;m really grateful and all. It was a huge, gorgeous thing you did for me. But I want to be able to do it myself.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Lily asks. She&#8217;s wide awake now, sitting up in her bed. Our whispers add a sense of urgency that shakes away all fogginess.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I mean, I want to learn how to swim. We come to Avenger Field all big and brave, like we can do anything. And I know that&#8217;s impossible. We&#8217;re not superheroes or anything. But I&#8217;d at least like to try. To say I gave it a try . . . Will you teach me?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily smiles at me, a kind, happy smile. She puts her hand on mine. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to. Although we&#8217;d best be careful, since  everyone thinks you can swim already.&#8221; Her eyes grow distant. When she looks at me again, they sparkle.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, this will be fun! It&#8217;ll be our little secret.&#8221; She grabs the covers in a gleefully conspiratorial way.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Mine, too, if you don&#8217;t keep it down,&#8221; Patsy grumbles from her bed. Patsy sleeps with a satin mask covering her eyes. She has earplugs, too, from her days working air shows, but she says she doesn&#8217;t like to sleep with them in because she might miss reveille.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; Lily and I whisper simultaneously, and then grin.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Tell you what, I&#8217;ll sleep on it,&#8221; Lily says. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll let you know what I come up with in the morning.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I glance at the clock in the dark, but it&#8217;s too dark to read. I know it must be late. &#8220;Of course. Go back to sleep. I&#8217;m sorry to wake you. And thanks, Lily. I owe you one.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s two, Jonesy.&#8221; She smiles and is asleep again almost before she can get the blanket over her head. Poor kid. All that swimming really took its toll. Somehow, I&#8217;ll find a way to repay her for the test and for the lessons, too.</div><div class="tx">It only takes me a moment longer to crawl back into bed and fall asleep. This time, I sleep without tossing. I sleep without dreams.</div></body></html>';

It&#8217;s Sunday afternoon and Lily and I are clinging to the edge of the town swimming pool like two shipwreck victims on a piece of flotsam. Well, at least I am. Lily looks as happy as a mermaid in the water. She bobs beside me, legs kicking in a soft froglike movement while she uses both hands to slide my death grip of forearms and elbows off the rim of the pool. If anyone asks, we&#8217;re just swimming for fun and a little exercise. Never mind the fact that I&#8217;m fighting it every step of the way.</div><div class="tx">The rest of the girls are back at the barracks sunning themselves or writing letters home. Better to be in the water, though, than out in the sun, where my skin will only get darker. Light as I am, I tan deeper than any white girl I&#8217;ve ever seen, and then claiming Spanish blood might not keep everyone from figuring me out.</div><div class="tx">Eventually I&#8217;m holding on just by my very tense fingertips. &#8220;See, Ida, that&#8217;s not so bad.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;If you say so.&#8221; She&#8217;s right, of course. It&#8217;s almost soothing, rocking in the cool water, but that&#8217;s until I look down the pool to the shadowy deep end. Then it&#8217;s Lake Pontchartrain all over again, and I can see my doom staring back at me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Really, Ida, if you&#8217;re going to be so melodramatic, maybe we should skip this altogether.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I blush. &#8220;Am I that bad?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, you are,&#8221; she tells me. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do this.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I consider it for a minute. She&#8217;s right. I could climb out of the water right now and never get back in again and it won&#8217;t matter. If I crash at sea, I&#8217;m dead, anyway.</div><div class="tx">Right?</div><div class="tx">I take a deep breath. &#8220;What&#8217;s next?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, you put your face in, of course. And I&#8217;ll teach you how to breathe.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I grin in spite of myself, in spite of the dread I feel. &#8220;Shoot, Lily, I thought that was the one thing I already knew.&#8221;</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Swim lessons are soon eclipsed by homework from our navigation class. Every single one of us knows how to fly places we&#8217;ve been before, and we&#8217;re getting good at plotting our course on maps, but up until now, we&#8217;ve only flown maneuvers over the auxiliary landing fields. Next week, we&#8217;ll be flying by the map, from Sweetwater to Baker&#8217;s Pond, a town about thirty miles away, and back. We&#8217;re expected to make the round trip in under an hour. Getting lost won&#8217;t exactly look good with the instructor in the backseat.</div><div class="tx">If we do well, we&#8217;re up for our first solo flights. That means an end to basic training, a test by an army pilot, and on to bigger and better planes. Audrey says a few girls usually wash out on the solo. I, for one, plan to pass.</div><div class="tx">Today, Instructor Martin teaches us about railroads. &#8220;They are simply the easiest guides to set your course by.&#8221; He hands out the train schedule for the region. We pass the little paper pamphlets around the room.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Study these, ladies. Notice the maps you plot on indicate train tracks with little hatch markings, like crisscrossed sticks. You may think you know where you are headed, and that&#8217;s fine. But remember, landmarks like barns and water towers are  a dime a dozen out here. Train tracks, on the other hand, are always the same and they&#8217;re always there. Unlike a barn or a water tower, train tracks don&#8217;t burn down, and they don&#8217;t pull them up too often. They&#8217;re as permanent as it gets.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;If you get lost in the clouds, bad weather, what have you, drop below cloud level and look for the tracks. Use your eyes. Understand? Use. Your. Eyes.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yessir,&#8221; we say as one. Instructor Martin is a real pain in the neck most of the time, but he&#8217;s an instructor for a reason. He&#8217;s got plenty to teach us, besides which, I think he sees the light at the end of the tunnel. He never forgot or forgave Patsy for her stunt that first day. If he can pass us on the basic test, we&#8217;ll be out of his hair for good. No more antics from Patsy and no more griping from the rest of us. The day we leave his class will be a red-letter day for Mr. Martin.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now, today is Wednesday. On Friday, you&#8217;ll be quizzed on what you&#8217;ve learned. Walter Jenkins, who instructs the intermediates, will join me in testing you. Each of you will have the honor of ferrying either Mr. Jenkins or myself out to Baker&#8217;s Pond and back again. It&#8217;s a lovely little hamlet out in the middle of nowhere. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll have no trouble finding it. I expect to see plotted courses tomorrow and weather charts the morning of the flight.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He looks down at his papers and busies himself with shuffling them about. We wait, sitting at attention. This has become a routine with us. The only way he can exert a little power over our rowdy bunch. He stands there behind his desk, humming some old Al Jolson tune, then with a huge sigh that would do a martyr proud, he says, &#8220;Class dismissed.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We grab our maps and charts in both arms and race out of there like Friday is a mean old dog that&#8217;s right on our heels.  &#8220;I still can&#8217;t find Baker&#8217;s Pond on my map,&#8221; Patsy groans. &#8220;Heck, for all I know, we might&#8217;ve done an air show there, but I wasn&#8217;t exactly doing the driving.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We&#8217;re sitting in the ready room, trying to finish our homework in peace. There&#8217;s a study lounge we could use, but right now it&#8217;s full of intermediates getting ready for their first instrument-only test. And the cots are full of everyone who&#8217;s too exhausted to keep studying. Patsy came up with the idea of the ready room as being the perfect place to chart our flights.</div><div class="tx">Lily has spread her map out on the floor and is standing on it. &#8220;A bird&#8217;s-eye view always helps me,&#8221; she explains. Then she frowns. &#8220;But not today. Maybe it&#8217;s like that mystical place Shangri-La, and it only shows up to those who are worthy.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;So that means every WASP before us was worthy, but we&#8217;re trash?&#8221; Patsy asks, raising an eyebrow.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That sounds about right, ladies.&#8221; We all look up. It&#8217;s Audrey Hill, our squadron leader. She walks in with the kind of confidence I&#8217;m starting to wish I could buy at the dime store. She breaks into a big grin. &#8220;Poor kids. From the sound of it, I&#8217;d say old Hap&#8217;s got you flying to Baker&#8217;s Pond.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Leave it to Hap,&#8221; Patsy says with a sarcastic smile. &#8220;All these lakes and reservoirs to choose from, and he has to pick the one that doesn&#8217;t exist.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I&#8217;m stretched out on a table, scanning my map with a magnifying glass. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been here a whole month and you still haven&#8217;t gotten a taste for small-town irony?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy looks at me, befuddled. I sigh. &#8220;You got one thing right&#8212;it&#8217;s likely it doesn&#8217;t exist. Not the way we&#8217;ve been thinking of it, that is. Look at your map. These lakes are huge. The reservoirs, too. But we&#8217;re looking for something smaller.  As dry as it&#8217;s been out here, Baker&#8217;s Pond is probably nothing but a shriveled up watering hole.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Audrey nods at me. &#8220;Listen to her, girls. She&#8217;s on to something.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;But then why&#8217;s it called Baker&#8217;s Pond?&#8221; Lily asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Why is it called &#8216;Sweetwater&#8217;?&#8221; I counter. &#8220;We&#8217;re thirteen miles from the nearest lake.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy frowns. &#8220;Hey, I think she&#8217;s right. This place has been drier than Prohibition.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s like wishful thinking, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Lily says. Her cheeks flush with excitement. &#8220;Like when you meet a big man nicknamed Tiny. Or Greenland, which is really icy, and Iceland, which is actually quite green.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy and I exchange smiles. &#8220;Okay. Now I think <i>she&#8217;s</i>  crazy, but you might be right, Ida.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Audrey gives us a little nod and waves goodbye. We turn back to our charts. My smile breaks into a grin.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ladies, remember the last thing Martin said to us about navigation?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Follow the train tracks,&#8221; Lily chimes in.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Precisely.&#8221; I open my train schedule and search the list of destinations.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now, we know the flight has to be less than an hour, so . . .&#8221; I take a compass and draw a circle with a forty-minute flight radius around Avenger Field, in case headwinds adjust the travel time. &#8220;Baker&#8217;s Pond isn&#8217;t on the list of train stops, but it must be near a track somewhere. These are the towns with train stations no more than an hour away.&#8221; I circle the towns on my list.</div><div class="tx">Lily and Patsy have come to stand beside me now. I feel  like I&#8217;m the instructor and I like it. This must be what Patsy meant by a chance to pay Lily back.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now, scan the chart. We&#8217;re looking for train tracks and a smooth blank spot on the map, near these towns. No hills, no lines. That&#8217;ll be our dry lake bed.&#8221; The topographical pictures on our own maps show lakes as blue puddles against crinkled pale green backgrounds. I scan my circle for the hatchmarks indicating train tracks. There. I put my finger down and follow it toward the north. No puddles, no towns. I go in the other direction, and head south. The train tracks stop in a town called Buckhorn and curve around to the east. Just about that curve, just east of Buckhorn, sits a plain brown dot. Below, printed for some unknown reason in green ink that is only slightly darker than the surrounding fields, is  <i>Baker&#8217;s Pond.</i></div><div class="tx">&#8220;Bingo.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Where?&#8221; Lily and Patsy lean forward, squinting.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Son of a&#8212;&#8221; Patsy breaks off.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida Mae, you&#8217;re a genius!&#8221; Lily exclaims.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Way to go, Jonesy.&#8221; Patsy grins at me. &#8220;One for all and all for one. You&#8217;re a regular musketeer.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She pats my shoulder and it feels good. Lily sighs. &#8220;Well, now the rest of the work begins,&#8221; she says. We all turn back to our own maps and begin working on our flight and weather charts. But I can still feel the glow from their congratulations, and it keeps me working hard all night.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Friday morning dawns with a few fat clouds high in the sky. Cumulus clouds, the kind that look like scoops of mashed potatoes or ice cream, so white they almost hurt to look at.  Everyone in our barracks is ready before roll call. There are some nervous grins, but mostly we&#8217;re just excited. Lily smiles at me as she calls roll.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Good luck, Flight One. I&#8217;ll see you in intermediates,&#8221; she ends the morning announcements. We all march to breakfast singing &#8220;Zoot Suits and Parachutes.&#8221; I eat a slice of toast, but I&#8217;m too excited to eat anything else. Patsy, on the other hand, has two sunny-side-up eggs and a ham steak.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You&#8217;ve got an iron stomach,&#8221; I tell her.</div><div class="tx">Patsy just smiles and mops up the broken yolks with a corner of toast. &#8220;Girl&#8217;s got to keep her energy up,&#8221; she says.</div><div class="tx">Next to me, Lily drinks a cup of warm milk. She takes a sip, puts her mug down carefully, and counts backward from ten.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Are you okay, Lily?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Fine.&#8221; She smiles nervously, her face turning a little green, and takes another sip of her milk. &#8220;I just . . . I just need to remember to breathe.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I put a hand on her back. &#8220;You&#8217;ll do fine.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy speaks around a mouthful of ham. &#8220;Just don&#8217;t forget how to fly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We all laugh, but I can hear Lily&#8217;s counting turn into something that sounds more like a prayer. The words are foreign, but the tone is familiar. Patsy and I share a look.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I guess we could all use some of that,&#8221; I say.</div><div class="tx">Lily looks up, cheeks red. &#8220;Sorry. I was just . . .&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No,&#8221; I say, and take her hand. Patsy puts down her fork and toast to pick up Lily&#8217;s other hand in her own.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Rabbi,&#8221; she says with a smile.</div><div class="tx">Lily blushes and fumbles for a moment. I squeeze her hand. She squeezes back.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, Lord,&#8221; she says in a trembling voice. &#8220;Lord God, hear our prayer. Give us strength . . .&#8221; She falters.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Protect us,&#8221; I add.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Pass us, Jesus,&#8221; Patsy says.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Bless our flight.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We sit there over our warm milk and toast, Patsy&#8217;s cooling eggs, and think our own thoughts.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Amen,&#8221; we say almost in unison. I feel good. I feel better. When we leave the mess hall, every single one of us is ready to fly.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">&#8220;Fuel line.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Check.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Wing?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Check.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Propeller.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Check.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s windy at the auxiliary landing airstrip. Those fat cumulus clouds are skidding lazily across the sky. I stop in the middle of my flight checklist to look at the wind sock floating atop the hangar that serves as storage, classroom, and control tower in one. The orange cone of fabric wafts to the south-east. Good. I&#8217;ll have a tailwind into Baker&#8217;s Pond. Every extra minute I gain is more time to fix any flubs in my navigation.</div><div class="tx">Instructor Martin is off and flying with Lily. I&#8217;m going up with Inspector Jenkins, the flight instructor for intermediate WASP. He&#8217;s a big man, the kind that played football in high school and never lost the broad shoulders or the wide neck. His hair is prematurely turning silver, and his eyes are bright and warm. As Jolene would say, &#8220;Not bad, for a white man.&#8221; I chuckle just thinking about her.</div><div class="tx">Inspector Jenkins reads out the preflight checklist to me, steadily ticking off each item. He has a nice voice to boot. I smile at him when he finishes the list, and he smiles right back. &#8220;All systems go,&#8221; I announce, and climb into the plane.</div><div class="tx">I strap my map to my leg with surgical tape. The course I&#8217;ve plotted is charted in red. Instructor Jenkins has a copy in the backseat of the plane. He looks it over silently, determined not to give me a hint whether or not I&#8217;ve done it all right.</div><div class="tx">We get the all clear over the radio, and I taxi out onto the runway. After that first week of flying with Martin, we&#8217;ve been allowed to handle takeoff and landing by ourselves. I start to grin as we head down the tarmac.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Watch yourself, Jones,&#8221; Jenkins says to me through the speaking tube by the throttle. I hesitate and do a mental check, but I&#8217;m not doing anything wrong.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Pardon, sir?&#8221; I shout into the tube.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That grin of yours, you don&#8217;t want to get any bugs in your teeth.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I laugh. I think I&#8217;m going to like intermediate training. I just have to pass basic first. We lift off into the blue sky and I smile even wider, but this time with my lips closed tight.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Being a WASP is all about being in the air. When we graduate from here, we will be assigned to bases across the country to do everything from ferrying newly made planes from factories to the coast&#8212;where they will be shipped off to our boys overseas&#8212;to towing targets for artillery practice. Some of the first WASP have already logged over a thousand flight hours. There&#8217;s even a story going around that Nancy Love and her Women&#8217;s Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron, the original twenty-eight women that eventually became the WASP, once ferried  a shipment of planes all the way across country in less than three days.</div><div class="tx">As Inspector Jenkins and I fly over the train tracks toward Buckhorn, I can&#8217;t imagine anything finer than seeing the whole country this way. We reach Buckhorn, and I tilt the wings to search for the riverbed I know will take us to Baker&#8217;s Pond.</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s not there.</div><div class="tx">Overgrown with brush or just blown away in these darn Texas winds, my landmark has gone AWOL.</div><div class="tx">Don&#8217;t panic, I tell myself. We made good time. I just need to be patient. I circle Buckhorn and get my bearings. Baker&#8217;s Pond should be dead east from here. I look at the sun, at the town, the tracks, the map and say a little prayer.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Everything okay, Jones?&#8221; Instructor Jenkins asks over the tube.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Roger wilco,&#8221; I say. &#8220;A-OK.&#8221; I just hope I&#8217;m right.</div><div class="tx">We fly for twenty minutes straight and I&#8217;m starting to feel those old butterflies again, slapping against my stomach, when the most beautiful sight in the world comes into view. Three buildings are huddled dead ahead of me, on the edge of a big brown sinkhole. I let out a whoop that would do a Hollywood Indian proud.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Welcome to Baker&#8217;s Pond, sir,&#8221; I shout into the speaking tube.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well done, Jones. And not a moment too soon,&#8221; Jenkins says.</div><div class="tx">We fly over what passes for a town and I can see the fifteen residents of Baker&#8217;s Pond sitting at the edge of their dried-up swimming hole, on top of their old cars and pickup trucks. Watching the WASP fly overhead is cause for a picnic in this town.</div><div class="tx">Some of the kids stand in the truck beds and wave.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Permission to waggle the wings, sir.&#8221; I can&#8217;t see Jenkins&#8217;s face, but I can tell he&#8217;s smiling. I like this man.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Permission granted.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We fly low over the pond bed and I tip my wings left, then right in salute to the fine people of Baker&#8217;s Pond. With another Hollywood whoop, I change course and we head back to Sweetwater.</div></body></html>';

I take my time undoing my turban and wait for the instructor to join us.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, Mr. Jenkins?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jenkins smiles and waves his clipboard. &#8220;A-plus, Miss Jones. You&#8217;ve passed. I look forward to seeing you in Intermediates.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221; I shake his hand, cool as November, and leave him to his next test subject. At least I think I&#8217;m cool. Lily nudges me as we head back to the ready room.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida Mae Jones, you&#8217;re blushing!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I am not,&#8221; I insist. &#8220;It must be windburn.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Right,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It must be Instructor &#8216;Windburn.&#8217; I don&#8217;t blame you, though. He&#8217;s a thousand times better looking than old mealymouthed Martin!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Lily!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s true!&#8221; We&#8217;ve reached the reading room. Lily drops down onto a bench. &#8220;Thank goodness that&#8217;s over!&#8221; she exclaims. &#8220;I thought for sure Martin was going to fail me, or demerit me, or I don&#8217;t know what.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I slap my thigh where the course map is still strapped to my pant leg. &#8220;Trust your map. No matter what old Martin says.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Amen to that!&#8221; Lily grabs my hand. &#8220;And thank you, Ida, so very much, for figuring it all out. If it weren&#8217;t for you, I&#8217;d  have flown that plane straight home to New York before I knew I was off course.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I smile and sit down beside her. &#8220;What was it Patsy said? One for all and all for one.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hear, hear.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I look around the ready room. &#8220;Where is Patsy, anyway? I thought she was due to go up with Martin right after you.&#8221; We look at the clock simultaneously. It&#8217;s already half-past fourteen hundred hours.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll be here any minute,&#8221; Lily says, but she doesn&#8217;t sound so sure.</div><div class="tx">We sit together in nervous silence. Most of the other girls who&#8217;ve passed their flight tests have gone back to the barracks or the mess hall. Lily and I are dismissed for the day, but we promised to wait for Patsy.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Maybe we should check with the tower,&#8221; I say after a minute.</div><div class="tx">Lily smiles hopefully. &#8220;Of course. But you know Patsy. She&#8217;s probably just pranking on old Martin again.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I smile back, but I don&#8217;t feel it on the inside. &#8220;That&#8217;s probably it,&#8221; I say doubtfully. We stand up. &#8220;She never could resist putting him in his place.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And on test day, too,&#8221; Lily adds.</div><div class="tx">But our bravado rings false. We break into a run outside the ready room. Sergeant Middleton is at the control tower.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Keep your pants on, ladies. They were spotted over Baker&#8217;s Pond about ten minutes ago. They should be here in about half an hour.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank God,&#8221; Lily gasps. I want to hug the sergeant, but the look he gives me makes me step back and simply nod at him.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sorry to bother you, sir.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He snorts and waves us away, but I notice he&#8217;s searching the skies himself. &#8220;Damn radio&#8217;s probably on the fritz,&#8221; he mutters as we leave the tower. &#8220;Don&#8217;t want to lose another plane.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Outside, Lily looks furious. &#8220;Another <i>plane</i>, did he say? Why, I ought to give him a piece of my mind!&#8221; She turns in her tracks, but I stop her.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go, Lily. He&#8217;s just as worried as we are, but he&#8217;s an army sergeant. He can&#8217;t afford to show it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily adjusts her shirt and nods. She lets out a deep breath from somewhere inside that petite body. &#8220;Well, thank God we&#8217;re not army.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I smile. &#8220;Come on. Let&#8217;s go wait for Patsy.&#8221; I pat my pockets as we walk back to the ready room. &#8220;Got any nickels?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily shakes her head. &#8220;I never fly with coins in my pocket. I once heard about a pilot who lost his loose change doing a loop. It killed a man on the ground. Can you believe it? They say a dime can do the same amount of damage as a Mack truck if you drop it from high enough up.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, I think a Mack truck dropped from a plane would hurt a whole lot more than a bitty old dime,&#8221; I tell her. She rewards me with a poke in the ribs.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You know what I mean. What&#8217;s the nickel for, anyway?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;The wishing well, of course.&#8221; The well was actually more of a small fountain outside of the ready room. It&#8217;s WASP tradition to toss coins into it for luck or toss WASP into it when they&#8217;ve done their first solo flight. &#8220;Today&#8217;s a big day,&#8221; I add. &#8220;I think it deserves more than a penny, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily agrees, but we don&#8217;t go to the ready room to ask the other girls for change. We don&#8217;t leave the field until we see Patsy&#8217;s plane on the horizon.</div><div class="tx">The sky is turning pale purple when she finally appears over the far end of the airstrip, signaling the tower.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;She&#8217;d better hurry up or she&#8217;ll qualify for a night landing,&#8221; Lily says.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yeah.&#8221; I keep my eyes on Patsy&#8217;s plane. She&#8217;s been gone too long. Way too long for it to be good news. Neither one of us has mentioned it, but Lily and I both know that this could be a washout offense.</div><div class="tx">Patsy lands beautifully and pulls to a stop just a few yards from where we are waiting. But she doesn&#8217;t get out of the plane. Even when old Martin hops down with his fussy little goggles clamped tightly to his head, a white scarf&#8212;far too romantic for a fellow as tight as Martin&#8212;thrown twice around his neck against the late-afternoon chill. Patsy just sits in the cockpit and stares straight ahead.</div><div class="tx">Martin walks past us without a word. His face is red, but whether from wind or something Patsy did, I can&#8217;t tell.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose she really did do a wing walk on him again, do you?&#8221; Lily asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, no, she&#8217;s smarter than that.&#8221; And then I think of that crowd of people sitting on their trucks and cars, watching us fly overhead. &#8220;At least, I think she is.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We wait for Instructor Martin to disappear into the ready room before we rush up to Patsy&#8217;s plane.</div><div class="tx">Patsy doesn&#8217;t see us at first. She&#8217;s too busy crying. Not sobbing hysterically, the way I would be if I had failed. Not angry, like we&#8217;ve seen her before. Just slow, quiet tears streaming down her pale cheeks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; Lily cries.</div><div class="tx">I climb up onto the side of the plane. &#8220;What is it, Patsy? Did he fail you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy jumps, startled to see me so close. She wipes her eyes, embarrassed. When she speaks, she sounds like her old self.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, he tried to, the old goose. Made me run through all the paces, basic training, first-week stuff, all the way to Baker&#8217;s Pond and back.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re late?&#8221; I ask hopefully.</div><div class="tx">She nods. &#8220;He was looking for a reason to flunk me. But I showed him. I was like you, Lily.&#8221; She tips her head toward the other girl. &#8220;A perfect student. He said do a loop, I did it perfectly. Do a roll, and I did one, a beautiful one, too. And we come up on Baker&#8217;s Pond, and there are all these farmers out there, standing on the hoods of their cars and the backs of their trucks, cheering, like we were the circus and the president rolled into one . . .&#8221; Patsy looks at us. The sunset catches her face in its glow.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;This was the best flight of my life, Jonesy. The best damn flight, ever.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Then why are you crying?&#8221; Lily asks, brow furrowed.</div><div class="tx">Patsy smiles slowly, but her smile is big and wide. &#8220;Tears of joy, hon. Tears of absolute joy.&#8221; She laughs. &#8220;He passed me. With flying colors, or almost. I had enough demerits for a one-way trip back to nowhere, but even old Martin thinks I&#8217;ve got the stuff.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She pulls herself out of the plane real slow, like she doesn&#8217;t want to leave it.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Come on, girls. It&#8217;s Friday night. We&#8217;re going to town to celebrate.&#8221;</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">&#8220;Town&#8221; means the Avengerette Club. Here in Texas they call it a honky-tonk hall. Back home, it&#8217;s a juke joint&#8212;the kind of  place Mama would never let me go. But tonight I&#8217;ll walk in with the rest of my friends, not as a teenager, but as a WASP. The brass consider the place an officers&#8217; club of sorts, suitable for WASP and military gentlemen. Nothing special on the inside, just a redecorated room above a store in town, donated by the good people of Sweetwater. Still, tonight is a celebration night. Patsy, Lily, and I indulge in extra-long showers, and we take the time to apply long-discarded makeup and curlers.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;d forgotten how much better I look with curled lashes,&#8221; Lily mutters, clamping down on her lash curler in front of the bathroom mirror. Thanks to Patsy&#8217;s delayed flight, the rest of our classmates are already at the club. The place should be in full swing by the time we get there.</div><div class="tx">This will be our first trip to the Avengerette. I guess part of me feels like I&#8217;m here to fly, not dance. And the other part of me knows Mama just wouldn&#8217;t approve. Socializing with white men will only get me into the kind of trouble she was worried about. And dancing with soldiers? That&#8217;s even worse. But tonight is special. I wish Jolene was here with me. She&#8217;s a regular social butterfly, and boy, can she dance.</div><div class="tx">The thought makes me sad enough to leave the mirror and take a breather at the foot of my bed. I haven&#8217;t written home but once or twice in the month since I got here, and that was just to send home some money and say I was okay. Nobody back home would be interested in basic training, or in my white classmates, or anything I&#8217;m doing right now. And besides, I&#8217;ve been waiting for something good to tell them. Something that would make Mama and Grandy proud. Today is finally one of those days.</div><div class="tx">I pull out the little stack of stationery I bought at the five-and-dime in town last month and put it in my purse. I&#8217;ve never been much for dancing. That&#8217;s Jolene&#8217;s specialty. But with luck, there&#8217;ll be a quiet corner where I can get my letter written.</div><div class="tx">A sneeze from the other side of the room makes me look up. &#8220;God bless you,&#8221; I say automatically.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; It&#8217;s Melanie Michaels, one of the girls from the other side of the barracks. She&#8217;s pale and yellow-haired, but her face is even paler than usual.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I thought everybody had gone out.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Almost,&#8221; I say. I close my purse. Melanie is wearing civilian clothes. So am I, but I&#8217;m in a party dress, black with tiny polka dots and fluted skirt. Melanie is wearing a tweed travel suit.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Melanie? Are you leaving?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She ignores the question and squats in front of a footlocker. &#8220;This is Nancy&#8217;s, right? She borrowed some shoes of mine. I want them back.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I put down my purse and go to her side. Melanie and I don&#8217;t know each other well, even if we do share a bathroom. She&#8217;s from Philadelphia, I think, or Connecticut. I kneel next to her.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s Nancy&#8217;s locker. But what&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Melanie looks at me and her face crumples like a newspaper, only all the headlines are sad. &#8220;Oh, Ida Mae, they flunked me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What?&#8221; I feel a chill all of a sudden, like angels passing overhead.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Baker&#8217;s Pond. I flunked the test.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I scowl. &#8220;Martin is a fool. We can appeal it. Go to Jenkins. He&#8217;s fair.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Melanie wails, &#8220;No, I can&#8217;t! He&#8217;s the one who failed me. Said I was indecisive and it could cost me my life, or my plane.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She sniffs through her tears and imitates Jenkins&#8217;s warm voice, but with a sneer to it that I don&#8217;t remember hearing. &#8220;&#8216;Miss Michaels, I&#8217;m sorry, but I won&#8217;t have your death on my hands. Or this airplane in yours.&#8217; He flew us back. It was so humiliating.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She throws her arms around my neck. I hug her, but there is nothing to say. If Hap Martin had flunked her, it would be one thing, but Walt Jenkins . . . I wish I had paid more attention, seen what she could do. All I can think is Jenkins must be right.</div><div class="tx">Melanie is the sixth girl to wash out of our flight, the first in our barracks. I try to remember who she was standing next to that first day, when Deatie Deaton said the girl to either side of each of us would fail. Whoever it was must be breathing a sigh of relief. Or feeling the same chill I&#8217;ve got right now.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;ll be okay, Melanie.&#8221; I say it, but I know it doesn&#8217;t help. How could it?</div><div class="tx">After a minute, Melanie pulls herself together. &#8220;There they are.&#8221; She pulls a pair of black pumps out of the locker. &#8220;Apologize to Nancy for me. I just . . .&#8221; She wipes her eyes. &#8220;I just didn&#8217;t want to have to tell all the girls.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We stand up. &#8220;I understand. I&#8217;ll let them know.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, tomorrow. Wait until tomorrow. They should be able to celebrate without pitying me tonight.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sure.&#8221; We hug quickly, and she is suddenly all business.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Good luck, Ida. You&#8217;ve always seemed like a swell girl. If you&#8217;re ever in Connecticut, look me up.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I will.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I walk with her to the door and watch her walk out into the night, her suitcase dragging along beside her, the pumps she lent Nancy still in her hand. I stare into the darkness after she is gone, glad not to be in her shoes.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Leaving without us?&#8221; Patsy asks. I jump at the sound of her voice.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, no. I was just . . . looking at the stars.&#8221; I shut the door and turn around. I give a low whistle. &#8220;Boy, you two sure got dolled up.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy is in a sky blue dress with a silk flower on one shoulder. Her straight black hair is curled into waves. Lily&#8217;s trapped her own natural curls into a bun with brown netting. A chocolate brown dress picks up the red of her hair and her creamy skin.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thanks, you&#8217;re a peach,&#8221; Lily says with a shake of her shoulder. She giggles. &#8220;Patsy&#8217;s been giving me lessons in sass.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;She learns quick.&#8221; Patsy winks. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get the show on the road, ladies. Last carload leaves the base in five minutes.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I grab my purse and follow them out into the warm Texas night. I don&#8217;t feel like celebrating anymore. Melanie Michaels has washed out. Any one of us could be next.</div></body></html>';

The building&#8217;s certainly seen better days, but you could hardly tell with the music streaming from the doorway and the lights shining so bright.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ready, girls?&#8221; Patsy asks, straightening her skirt and primping her hair.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;As I&#8217;ll ever be,&#8221; Lily says.</div><div class="tx">My eye falls on the WHITES ONLY sign pasted in the window. My stomach fills with butterflies. &#8220;Lead on,&#8221; I say, setting my jaw and swallowing my nerves. The back of my neck itches when we enter the door, but I don&#8217;t let it stop me. I&#8217;m a white girl tonight. I&#8217;m a WASP.</div><div class="tx">No dogs come running and no one throws me out. My teeth unclench and I pause a moment to take it all in. The Andrews Sisters are crooning in three-part harmony on a record player set up on a corner table next to a small soda pop machine. Somebody must flip the records when they end. But it&#8217;s smack-dab in the middle of &#8220;Dream a Little Dream&#8221; right now, and six or seven couples are swaying on the dance floor. I scan the little caf&#233; tables hemming the dance area. Patsy does the same.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;My, my. Look at all the pretty boys,&#8221; she says with a predatory smile that reminds me of Jolene. I&#8217;ve never been to a dance hall before, or a bar. From the drab paint job to the scuffed tables, it&#8217;s a lot less glamorous than I expected.  &#8220;Whites only&#8221; isn&#8217;t exactly a sign of quality, I guess. Jolene will get a kick out of that.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;They come in from all over, I hear,&#8221; Lily says. &#8220;Every base within a forty-mile radius. The WASP are very popular girls.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Not too popular, I hope.&#8221; It&#8217;s our squadron leader, Audrey Hill, sitting at a nearby table with a group of senior girls. &#8220;Mrs. Deaton frowns on fraternizing too often with the enemy.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;She means men,&#8221; one of the other upperclassmen says. She&#8217;s a redhead with high-arched eyebrows. By the way she&#8217;s decked out like a regular Rita Hayworth, I&#8217;d say she&#8217;s looking to engage &#8220;the enemy&#8221; head-on.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Girls, this is Randi, and this is Charlotte.&#8221; Audrey introduces us to her friends. Charlotte, who looks a little bored with the whole evening, nods and goes back to nursing her Coca-Cola.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Patsy asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Rum and Coke,&#8221; Charlotte says with a drawl that sounds too soft for Texas. She taps a flask peeking out of her purse.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Barkeep, three thirsty women with heavy tipping hands!&#8221; Patsy calls down to a fella standing by the Coke machine, flipping him some change. Before I know it, there&#8217;s a bottle of Coke in my hand. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s a virgin,&#8221; Patsy assures me. &#8220;See you on the dance floor, ladies,&#8221; Patsy tells Audrey and her pals. Lily and I share a look, but we both know Patsy is the leader tonight. She finds us a table with two servicemen, one with big teeth and the other so short that when they stand up to greet us, he looks like he&#8217;s still sitting down.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m Hank!&#8221; the big-toothed fellow says, and shakes our hands. &#8220;And this is Danny! We fly gunnery at Waco! We ship  out next month!&#8221; Everything he says sounds like an exclamation. It makes me smile.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m Lily,&#8221; she says, making her own introduction.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And I&#8217;m Ida.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Hank eagerly shakes our hands. &#8220;And who&#8217;s your friend?&#8221; He offers his giant hand to Patsy. Patsy shakes his fingertips delicately.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m just here to dance, flyboy. Can you shake it?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Boy, can I!&#8221; Big-toothed Hank hops up and whirls Patsy out onto the dance floor just as the record flips to some music that really swings.</div><div class="tx">Benny Goodman starts heating up his band. Lily looks at the dance floor the way I used to look at the clouds in the sky. &#8220;Harry and I used to dance at the Palladium every Friday night.&#8221; Even with her legs crossed, Lily&#8217;s toe is dipping to the music.</div><div class="tx">I catch her eye and nod toward Danny, who is politely watching nothing in particular. Lily takes a deep breath.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Excuse me, Danny. I know we&#8217;ve just met and it isn&#8217;t proper for a lady to ask a gentleman first . . .&#8221; She pauses and we both glance at Patsy, whirling around the dance floor, not in the least bit worried about being a proper lady. Lily takes another big breath. &#8220;And I know you&#8217;re shipping out soon and most likely are looking for some sort of romance, but&#8212;&#8221; She holds up her diamond engagement ring. &#8220;I&#8217;m engaged, you see, but I&#8217;d like it awfully much if you&#8217;d care to dance with me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Danny&#8217;s eyes seem to refocus. He looks at Lily like he&#8217;s seeing her for the first time.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m married, just last week,&#8221; he says excitedly. &#8220;As long as we&#8217;re both taken, I guess it&#8217;s okay.&#8221; He stands up and he&#8217;s exactly Lily&#8217;s height.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hank dragged me here looking for a little fling, but I told him I&#8217;m not interested. Not when I have my Annie. But it would be swell to dance before the night is over.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Really?&#8221; Lily&#8217;s eyes sparkle. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I can almost feel myself fade into the background as they hit the dance floor. I thought Patsy could cut a rug, but Lily&#8217;s a regular Ginger Rogers out there. Danny&#8217;s no slouch, either. The whole dance floor makes room as he flips Lily over his back and around again into a cuddle and a series of half-moons so quick I think she&#8217;ll break her neck.</div><div class="tx">I have to admit, it looks like a blast. Lily could give Jolene a run for her money. With the whole shack watching the dance floor, I realize Melanie was right. Tonight is about celebrating. If I&#8217;d wanted to tell anybody about her washing out, now I simply don&#8217;t have the heart.</div><div class="tx">Instead, I pull my stationery out of my purse and start my letter home. <i>Dear Mama,</i> I begin. <i>It&#8217;s been too long since I&#8217;ve last written, but I do have good news. I navigated my first flight today, and I passed. If all goes well, I&#8217;ll move on to intermediate training next month. With any luck, I&#8217;ll be home after Christmas, and then I&#8217;ll be assigned to a base . . .</i></div><div class="tx">My thoughts trail off. Someone is standing over me. Nancy Howard, from my barracks.</div><div class="tx">We&#8217;ve never been friends, not since that first day, but at least we&#8217;re civil.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hey, Jones. Have you seen Michaels? She was supposed to meet up with us tonight.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I open my mouth and close it again. &#8220;Uh, no.&#8221; I shrug. &#8220;Sorry.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Nancy gives me a funny look, then smiles. &#8220;Okay. See you out there.&#8221; She jitterbugs back to the dance floor. I finish my  letter home, then one to Jolene, telling her about the Avengerette. By the time I&#8217;m done, the lights are flickering on and off, announcing one more dance before the club closes.</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s only then that I realize Patsy and Lily never left the dance floor. They don&#8217;t even look tired out there, although I see Patsy is no longer dancing with Hank. She&#8217;s got her arms around the shoulders of some corn-fed redhead. He&#8217;s smiling like he&#8217;s struck gold, but Patsy only has eyes for the dance floor as she moves, dreamy-eyed, to the music.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Excuse me. May I have this dance?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I almost spill the last of my Coke. Instructor Jenkins is standing in front of me with his hand out.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Instructor Jenkins, I didn&#8217;t know you were here.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He laughs. &#8220;How could you? You&#8217;ve had your head buried in that letter all night.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I blush and fold my letters back into my purse.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What do you say? Last chance to really celebrate.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m not allowed to dance with a&#8212;&#8221; I stop myself from saying &#8220;white man.&#8221; Jenkins raises an eyebrow.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;With an instructor?&#8221; Jenkins asks. I blush and remember Deatie Deaton&#8217;s bylaws. Something about fraternizing with the instructors . . . I hesitate. The rules of the South don&#8217;t apply to Jonesy, I remind myself, but Mrs. Deaton&#8217;s bylaws do.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Miss Jones, I&#8217;m off duty.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I don&#8217;t move. He might be an off-duty instructor, but am I off duty as a colored girl? His hand is still outstretched, reaching for mine. I think of my mother&#8217;s warnings&#8212;is this the line she told me I might cross?</div><div class="tx">The moment&#8217;s stretched so long I feel awkward saying no,  even if it&#8217;s the wrong answer. Besides, it&#8217;s just one dance. If I stick to my charade, what harm can there be in it?</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, all right.&#8221; His warm hand closes over mine. I follow him to the dance floor. I&#8217;ve never held hands with a white man before. In the South, even in the U.S. Army, this dance is all but illegal. There&#8217;s a strange thrill in knowing it. Is this how Stevia Johnson felt when she went on the first date with her white boss?</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Cold hands,&#8221; Instructor Jenkins says. &#8220;Warm heart.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I laugh, and I know it sounds nervous for too many reasons. You&#8217;re white now, Ida. And never mind Stevia Johnson. It&#8217;s just one dance. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m better at flying than dating&#8212;I mean, dancing.&#8221; I blush at my mistake. I&#8217;m not looking him in the eye, but he doesn&#8217;t seem to notice. They never play fast songs when you need them.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I see what you mean.&#8221; He laughs. &#8220;You like to lead.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Is that it? I thought I just had two left feet.&#8221; I look over his shoulder to find Lily and Patsy staring back at me over the shoulders of their own partners. I start to feel sick, like the whole world can see what&#8217;s going on. Instructor Jenkins is a nice fella, but he&#8217;s a teacher. And he&#8217;s twice my age. Even if he wasn&#8217;t white, which he is, I don&#8217;t even know his first name.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Walter,&#8221; he says.</div><div class="tx">I practically jump out of my skin. On top of all of it, he&#8217;s a mind reader, too. &#8220;What did you say?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;My name. You said you didn&#8217;t know my first name. It&#8217;s Walter. Walt.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh.&#8221; I flush hot and tingly. What else did I say out loud? I wonder. I keep my mouth shut for the rest of the dance,  concentrating on ignoring the gawking faces of my friends and every other flygirl in the place. Why, oh why did he have to ask me to dance? He&#8217;s an instructor, soon to be <i>our</i> instructor. I&#8217;m never going to live this down.</div><div class="tx">Mercifully, the song finally ends and everyone claps, as if the record player was a real live band. MPs did not come crashing through the door. The local lynch mob hasn&#8217;t come to take me away, and I&#8217;m not dead yet from pure embarrassment.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Miss Jones.&#8221; Instructor Jenkins shakes my hand. &#8220;Get home safely.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Jenkins . . . Walt . . . Jenkins.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He&#8217;s smiling, laughing at me, but he nods and lets me scurry back to my table. I grab my purse and stand there with my back to the room.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What was that?&#8221; Patsy asks me as she disengages from her redheaded dance partner. He waves goodbye and leaves her alone with me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Nothing. Just a celebration dance.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s illegal to dance with teachers.&#8221; Lily comes up to us, her forehead wrinkled with worry. &#8220;I heard they never even come here.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Illegal?&#8221; I repeat. My stomach sinks. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t do anything wrong.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sure, honey.&#8221; Patsy&#8217;s droll voice cuts through my thoughts. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t done anything wrong. Yet.&#8221; She winks at me. &#8220;No wonder you scored so well on your test. He was grading you on your curves.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My face flushes and I&#8217;m washed in a wave of guilt, over the dance, over passing, over the swim test I should have failed. I go from embarrassed to defensive in five seconds flat  to hide my shame. &#8220;What do you know, anyhow? You&#8217;re the one dancing with every man in the place. And we both know you&#8217;d still be flying over Buckhorn if it weren&#8217;t for me, or worse, you&#8217;d be washed up and sent home like Melanie Michaels, so get off my case.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">As soon as the words are out of my mouth, I wish I could turn them off, make the whole room go deaf. Patsy and Lily stare at me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What did you say?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I close my eyes, but when I open them, they&#8217;re still there, and a few other girls besides, Nancy among them.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I thought you said you hadn&#8217;t seen her,&#8221; Nancy says accusingly.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I . . . I lied.&#8221; I sit down at the table. It&#8217;s too late to put the cat back in the bag. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. She asked me not to say anything tonight. She wanted us all to have fun. Jenkins failed her, and she must&#8217;ve had more demerits than we knew about. She went home right before we came here.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I look up at the girls around me. The look on their faces makes me sorrier than ever that I opened my mouth. Patsy sits down next to me, but her eyes are far away. &#8220;We were just teasing you, Jonesy.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I know. I&#8217;m just . . . It&#8217;s a long story.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy takes my hand. &#8220;Hey, kid. Tell it to us sometime. It might help.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I shrug. Any story I give them will only be part of the truth, unless I tell them everything. And even then they could never understand what it felt like, being a colored girl in the arms of a white man who could destroy me if he knew what I was. Overhead, the lights flicker on and off.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Closing, ladies,&#8221; a man by the door announces. He jingles a ring of keys.</div><div class="tx">Not a single WASP moves.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;One for the road, buddy?&#8221; Patsy asks.</div><div class="tx">The poor man looks about to say no. It&#8217;s been a long night. I imagine he&#8217;s got a home and a family to get back to. But then, with the same expression of dutiful patriotism with which Jolene and I used to collect bacon grease and silk stockings, he plugs the vending machine back in. &#8220;It&#8217;s just soda, ladies. You still have to get back to base.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sir, yes, sir,&#8221; Patsy says. We pass out one last round of fizzing colas and sit together for a moment in silence. I look at the faces around me, every last girl from my flight and a few from other barracks. We all look so different, short, tall, dark, light. But the expression on every face is the same.</div><div class="tx">Lily raises her Coke. &#8220;To Melanie.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;To Melanie.&#8221; We toast with a click of our glasses.</div><div class="tx">In the small hours of the morning, I sit in the bathroom between our sleeping bays and add a page to my mother&#8217;s letter. I tell her nothing about Instructor Jenkins, how the weight of his arm feels like a brand around my waist, or my fear, or anything that would give away my secret. Instead, I tell her about Melanie, how her failure clings to me like unwanted perfume, how hard training can be sometimes. Then I tell my mother that I will not fail. And I find myself wishing she were here to convince me that I am right.</div></body></html>';

I think Melanie Michaels&#8217;s departure screwed my flight&#8217;s courage to the sticking place. All of us passed and began our intermediate training with little fanfare and a lot of hard work. Instructor Jenkins is a complete professional in the classroom. Since that night at the Avengerette, no one has mentioned our slow dance, not even him.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ladies, when you leave these fine flying fields, you will be stationed from California to Delaware. Some of you will be towing targets for artillery practice. Some of you will fly test planes or weather-checking missions. Many of you will ferry airplanes from the factory to the coast. All of you will need to trust your instruments to fly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I bounce my pen on my notebook, waiting for him to tell me something I&#8217;ll need to remember. Up to now, most of our classes have been about theory. Today, we try our hand at the Link trainer.</div><div class="tx">We follow Jenkins to the training room and stand nervously while he shows us the equipment. The room itself looks just like the beginner classroom, except the student desks are on a platform and the lower third of the floor is taken up by the Link.</div><div class="tx">The Link trainer is a simulator. It looks like an airplane cockpit, black metal and bullet-shaped, but unlike a plane, the top of the cockpit is dark. Once inside, you&#8217;re &#8220;flying&#8221; blind,  with only the dials and gauges on the control panel to tell you which way is up. I&#8217;m so anxious to get started, I volunteer to go first. The cockpit closes over me with a sharp click. Climbing into the Link is a little like going underwater. Shut inside that warm darkness, suddenly I&#8217;m drowning in Lake Pontchartrain all over again.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Miss Jones, can you hear me?&#8221; Jenkins&#8217;s voice comes over a radio speaker, loud and clear. It&#8217;s hard to believe that just a few feet away, Lily and Patsy are standing with the rest of my class. Jenkins himself sits at a control panel that mirrors my own. He&#8217;ll know every move I make.</div><div class="tx">I take a deep breath. &#8220;Affirmative,&#8221; I say. My voice is strained. I&#8217;m sweating, even though the box isn&#8217;t hot. It&#8217;s just like a cockpit, same size and shape, but it feels smaller, like my knees are tucked into my chest.</div><div class="tx">Breathe, Ida Mae. Breathe.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Jenkins&#8216;s voice says. &#8220;I want you to start your taxi and take off. Cruise at one thousand feet. I&#8217;ll tell you what to do next.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, sir. Flight check.&#8221; I go over the flight check in my head. The routine helps to calm my breathing. Check. Check. Check.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Taxiing,&#8221; I say. The Link doesn&#8217;t move. Nothing moves but the speedometer and altimeter. This is not like flying to me. The Link box just sits there. There&#8217;s no wind in my hair, no sun on my skin. Not even stars or the wet feel of cloud spray. This is just mechanics.</div><div class="tx">My throat gets tight. My vision starts to dim. Suddenly, this little box is too small for me to have ever even gotten inside of it.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Jones, are you all right?&#8221; Jenkins&#8217;s voice sounds far away.</div><div class="tx">I don&#8217;t know how long he has been calling my name. I try to respond, but I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m drowning. I start to bang on the hatch. The tiniest part of me, the part that says not to panic or I&#8217;ll wash out, is suffocated by the screaming animal inside of me that says I am going to die if I don&#8217;t leave this box.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Jones!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The hatch whooshes open with a burst of sweet, cool air. I throw back my head and grab the sides of the opened cockpit, gasping for breath. I can&#8217;t draw it in fast enough.</div><div class="tx">A hand takes mine. I hold on to it the way I held on to my daddy&#8217;s hand beneath the lake, feeling it pull me up into the light.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Slow down, Ida. Take a deep breath and open your eyes.&#8221; Walt Jenkins is there, his hand clutching mine, a look of worry in his eyes. I cling to his hand and fight to do as I&#8217;m told.</div><div class="tx">With each slow breath, my panic slides away. Embarrassment takes its place. The whole class is watching us. It feels worse than our dance at the Avengerette. Jenkins lets go of my hand, his eyes no longer worried, and squeezes my shoulder.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you, Miss Jones. That will be all.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My stomach hits the floor. I leave it and all of my big dreams behind in the Link. <i>That will be all.</i> I&#8217;m going to be sent back home. My legs tremble slightly. I go stand between Patsy and Lily, who give me worried looks but otherwise leave me be. I wonder if failure can rub off onto other people, the way Melanie Michaels must have rubbed off on me.</div><div class="tx">But that&#8217;s ridiculous. In the end, I failed because I&#8217;m lying. I&#8217;m only pretending to be white. White kids never tangled in the undertow of Lake Pontchartrain. As light as I am, no matter what I do, I&#8217;m still that little colored child who almost drowned.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And that, ladies, was a classic example of what can happen while flying under the hood,&#8221; Instructor Jenkins says, using the more common term for flying instruments only under a covered hatch. &#8220;It&#8217;s called a panic attack, in this case brought on by claustrophobia.&#8221; Jenkins smiles at me, and I want to slap the smile off his face. How did I not hear the sarcasm in that friendly voice before? Melanie did. Now I do, too. Like the instructor at Tuskegee. It hurts to hear.</div><div class="tx">Maybe he sees the look on my face, but Jenkins stops smiling. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Miss Jones, it happens to the best of us.&#8221; He takes a step toward me and his voice softens. &#8220;It happens to most of us. You get inside that box or a plane at night, and you don&#8217;t know up from down.&#8221; I feel myself flush. Fortunately, he turns back to face the rest of the class. Why does this man make me feel so flustered?</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We&#8217;re creatures of the daylight, ladies,&#8221; Jenkins continues. &#8220;We like the sky above us and the earth below. But under the hood, all of your natural instincts go out the window. Sometimes the stars can look like city lights and you fly too high. Sometimes tailwinds send you faster or slower than you thought and you miss your landing mark.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;But that is why you have Link training. And that is why you have me.&#8221; He puts his hand fondly on the Link. &#8220;Contrary to what you&#8217;ve seen today, the Link is our friend. You will all get a chance to try it. You will all have your own moment of panic. And then you will listen to me. We will retrain your instincts. And every last one of you will fly out of here, day or night, as if they are one and the same.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My stomach slowly rises back to its usual spot. I am not a failure. I am like everyone else. But I need to see it to believe  it. Jenkins steps back from the trainer and offers the door. &#8220;Next?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy edges forward to give it a shot. Of all of us, she ends up being the one that lasts the longest that first day. Ten whole minutes. Hardly long enough to fly halfway to Baker&#8217;s Pond. But I&#8217;m not alone. I haven&#8217;t failed, not really, not yet. I watch each girl&#8217;s face as they climb out of the Link like they are rising out of a coffin. Then I grit my teeth and prepare to do it again.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">&#8220;Ida! Ida, come up!&#8221; Lily&#8217;s voice carries through the water like an old gramophone recording. Stretched, thin, and bubbly, it sounds more like she&#8217;s the one underwater instead of me.</div><div class="tx">I give her a thumbs-up, then hold up all ten fingers. Ten seconds more. I&#8217;ve been sitting at the bottom of the town swimming pool for twenty seconds. Ten more and I&#8217;ll have reached my goal. My lungs ache. I want to open my mouth and exhale. At the mere thought, bubbles escape my nose. I try to stay calm, but I&#8217;m already shoving off the rough pool bottom toward the surface. I break through the top with a gasp.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida, thank goodness. You know you scare me when you stay down so long.&#8221; Lily rushes toward me with a white towel. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll be able to tell if you ever get in trouble down there.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I accept the towel gratefully and dry my face before wrapping the towel around my shoulders. &#8220;Oh, believe me, you&#8217;ll know, from all the thrashing and churning I&#8217;ll do. I don&#8217;t think anybody ever drowns peacefully.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily frowns. &#8220;Ophelia did, in <i>Hamlet.</i>&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, you only hear about it afterward. They always candy-coat that stuff.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I shiver beneath the little towel. Lily frowns.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Goodness, you must be cold. It&#8217;s getting too chilly to keep doing this before spring, Ida. Maybe we should give it a rest.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I hate to admit it, but she&#8217;s right. &#8220;It is only warm in the sun these days.&#8221; Even in New Orleans, December was usually cause for a cold snap. And no one wants to believe how cold it can get in the South in the wintertime, even without snow.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;ll be warm at the Beach. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The Beach is actually the strip of sand that runs between the rows of barracks. Thanks to the metal siding of the buildings and the lack of trees, the Beach gets hot enough to suntan in year-round, according to the upperclassmen. I&#8217;ve avoided it until now, because, quite frankly, getting a tan is the last thing I should be doing here, and not just because of the workload. The minute I get a shade darker than I am, I&#8217;m convinced a group of MPs will descend on me and throw me into the hoosegow.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll just take a shower,&#8221; I tell Lily as we reach the barracks. She shrugs.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;ll only be out for a little while. I burn like crazy in the sun,&#8221; she says. She grabs the chair from the foot of her bed and drags it behind her into the yard. I wait for her to leave before I carefully undo my hair from its swim cap. It&#8217;s become a ritual, pulling it straight and tight, braiding the ends so they tuck up neatly beneath the two swimming caps I wear, with a little towel sandwiched underneath the rim. Whatever it takes to keep my hair from getting too wet, too kinky. It&#8217;s  harder now that I can sit underwater for so long. Sometimes you can see the air bubbles squeeze past your ears and let the water in. That&#8217;s when I came up with the towel. At least it keeps the water from the crown of my head. Now, a lot of girls wear swim and shower caps during the week&#8212;there&#8217;s just not enough time in the morning to deal with shampoo. But my little getup is just strange enough that I try not to let anyone see it.</div><div class="tx">Once my hair is safely unbraided, I comb setting lotion through with my fingers and look out the door while I massage it into the damp ends. Colored or white, setting lotion is a girl&#8217;s best friend. It can help a style hold all day or, in my case, keep my hair from frizzing up. The smell of the lotion reminds me of Jolene and how we&#8217;d sit together at the beauty parlor on our days off, laughing and gossiping under the big hair dryers. My stomach feels hollow from missing her. With all the studying and flying, I&#8217;m usually too busy to feel home-sick. But not today. Today is a lazy day. It&#8217;s hard not to think of home.</div><div class="tx">Outside the door, Lily and about seven other girls are out there, stretched out in swimsuits and nighties on the strand, their desk chairs tilted seat down on the ground so they can use the backs like lounge chairs. It&#8217;s down to a fine science, the art of sunbathing at Avenger Field. Patsy waves at me from her lounge chair. I smile and turn to take my shower.</div><div class="tx">The hot water feels good running over my shoulders. I&#8217;ve tucked my hair into a shower cap to help the lotion soak in, and the water bounces off of it in a rapid pitter-pat. I sing little bits of &#8220;Zoot Suits and Parachutes&#8221; in my off-key voice. Halfway through, I switch to that ditty Jolene and I used to  listen to while we cleaned the Wilson place. &#8220;T&#8217;aint whatcha do, it&#8217;s the place that you do it! T&#8217;aint whatcha do, it&#8217;s the time that you do it!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">By the time I&#8217;m out of the shower, the other girls have come in from the beach. &#8220;Almost ready, Ida?&#8221; Patsy calls. I quickly pull on a sweater and skirt. Christmas is coming to Avenger Field. We&#8217;re going into town to shop for the holidays.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ready when you are.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy and Lily have joined with some of the girls from the barracks next door to take us into town. One of the girls is from Houston. She drove to training and keeps her car at the field. I haven&#8217;t spent much time in the actual town of Sweetwater. I feel more comfortable on the base, where I don&#8217;t have to worry about NO COLOREDS signs or worse. Still, I&#8217;m feeling good after my successful swim lesson, and I desperately want to get Mama, Grandy, and the boys something nice for Christmas.</div><div class="tx">The ride into town is chilly, chillier than it has been in Sweetwater since we first arrived. Bad enough it&#8217;s December, but the cold gets even worse at night. On the open plains, it drops twenty degrees or more when the sun sets. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have to buy myself another sweater,&#8221; I tell Lily as we climb out of the car.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We&#8217;re the same size. I&#8217;ve got a dozen of them in one of my trunks,&#8221; she says. &#8220;You can have whatever you need.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The rest of us stop in our tracks. &#8220;You still have your steamer trunks?&#8221; Patsy asks. &#8220;I thought they made everyone ship them back home after the first day.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily blushes deep red. &#8220;My mother was horrified at the thought of leaving me out in the &#8216;wilds of America&#8217; improperly dressed. She doesn&#8217;t know about Urban&#8217;s turbans, or the  zoot suits, or anything. It would kill her. So my clothes are in storage down at the train station. Don&#8217;t tell anyone at the base.&#8221; She shakes her head. &#8220;It really is too much.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We laugh and head off down Main Street to see what we can see. &#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to buy a new tablecloth for Mrs. Harper,&#8221; Patsy says. &#8220;She was the sweetest little lady you could ever meet. Ran the boardinghouse in Florida where I lived last season with my air show. Closest thing I&#8217;ve got left to family, next to you girls.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, Patsy,&#8221; Lily says. We squeeze her hands and she squeezes back.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;The life of a wing-walking gypsy, eh?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;There&#8217;s a linens shop just down the road,&#8221; Lily offers. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you can find something there.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Join me?&#8221; Patsy asks us.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, no, I&#8217;ve got to find the drugstore and see if they have Mother&#8217;s favorite perfume. It&#8217;s a tradition, every Hanukkah.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What about you, Jones? Anything on your list in the way of linens?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I shrug. &#8220;My mother might be able to use a new towel or two.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Or maybe an apron?&#8221; Patsy suggests with an encouraging waggle of her eyebrows. I laugh.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Maybe. But it would be nice to get her something that didn&#8217;t remind her of all the work she has to do.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;There&#8217;s always perfume,&#8221; Lily suggests. The thought makes me laugh again.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You don&#8217;t know my mother. She&#8217;d say, &#8216;Ida Mae, God gave us soap to keep us clean. Why do I need to cover it up with lilacs or lilies?&#8217; Oh, no offense, Lily,&#8221; I add. But Patsy and Lily are both laughing.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Then I guess bubble bath is out of the question.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; I admit. &#8220;I really haven&#8217;t thought of anything good, except for an awl for my grandfather. There&#8217;s a hardware store around here somewhere, right?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily shrugs. &#8220;I suppose so, but we&#8217;ll have to ask.&#8221; She looks at her watch. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to hurry, too, if we want to get back to base and finish our homework before dinner.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, that settles it, musketeers,&#8221; Patsy announces. &#8220;One for one and all for themselves. Meet you back here in forty-five minutes, presents or no presents. I&#8217;ve got a tablecloth to hunt down.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We all nod and walk off in our separate directions. I haven&#8217;t gone far down the sidewalk before I realize that I have no direction. Sweetwater is a small town, so I imagine I can manage to find the hardware store without any help. There just aren&#8217;t that many streets to walk down. But this is the first time I&#8217;ve been alone in Texas since I got here and it makes me nervous. As long as Lily and Patsy are with me, I blend in and look like I belong. But the minute they disappear into their storefronts, I can&#8217;t help but start seeing the WHITES ONLY signs hanging in every window.</div><div class="tx">A second look tells me it&#8217;s not every store, just the nice ones where Lily and Patsy have gone. I remind myself who I&#8217;m supposed to be and head off down the street once again. I doubt there are two hardware stores on Main Street.</div><div class="tx">The street is full of strollers, window-shopping and gathering Christmas gifts. A little towheaded kid runs by me in dungarees and a camel jacket. &#8220;Hey, Tigger!&#8221; he shouts. I jump, then realize he&#8217;s not talking to me. A little brindle-striped dog has just rounded the corner. The boy doesn&#8217;t see him. He looks about close to tears. &#8220;Tigger, where are you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I swallow my fear and call to the boy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, he&#8217;s just over there.&#8221; I point to where the dog is standing in the shadow of a lamppost, his pink tongue lolling as if he is laughing at the whole adventure. The boy grins at me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thanks, lady. I thought he was lost for sure.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I smile back. The boy reminds me of Abel. &#8220;You&#8217;d better go fetch him,&#8221; I say.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re one of them army airplane ladies, aintcha? Out at the base?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My smile gets even bigger. &#8220;That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m training to be a WASP.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The boy&#8217;s eyes gleam with what I mistake for enthusiasm. Too late, I realize, it&#8217;s mischief. &#8220;My mama says the WASP are easy women. Loose as a goose, she says. Is that true?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My smile drops into a deep frown. An angry fizzle fills my chest, but there&#8217;s no point taking it out on a child. I don&#8217;t let my shock show on my face. &#8220;Son, your dog&#8217;s getting away.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The kid turns to see Tigger disappear around the corner. Without another word to me, he takes off after the dog, shouting its name.</div><div class="tx">Half a block later, I find the hardware store. I walk in through the front door and think about how Grandy always has to use the rear entrance at the big hardware store back home or shop at the smaller Negro-owned one outside of town. I hold my head up high, so high that I almost run into a stock boy.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Whoa, sorry, miss,&#8221; the kid says. He can&#8217;t be more than fifteen. I feel like a real adult compared to him, and I act like one.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s quite all right, young man,&#8221; I say. &#8220;But maybe you can help me. I&#8217;m looking for an awl.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;An awl?&#8221; The boy&#8217;s face screws up, and for a moment I think he doesn&#8217;t know what I mean.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, an awl. You know, for boring holes in wood?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, yes, I know,&#8221; he says, sounding insulted. &#8220;I&#8217;m just trying to think of where I put them.&#8221; He smiles self-consciously. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been here four weeks, and I&#8217;m still trying to get the inventory down right. You might ask Jacob, up front. He&#8217;s real good at recalling the stock.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; I squeeze down a narrow aisle of penny nail bins and make my way to the counter. A colored farmer is standing in line before me, overalls dusted with clay, rough hands holding a new length of chain out to the store clerk. The look of distaste on the clerk&#8217;s face is evident. I&#8217;ve seen that look before, aimed at me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sorry, MacIntyre, we don&#8217;t have any more like that.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to buy more. I want to return it. You sold me more than I need.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We don&#8217;t take returns on cut chain, boy, you know that.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">It burns me to hear a man as old as my grandfather called &#8220;boy.&#8221; But I duck my head, the way I&#8217;ve always done, and listen, and take it. And so does the farmer, MacIntyre.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Can I trade for it, then? I could use some nails for the barn door.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The store clerk shakes his head. &#8220;Sorry. May I help you, miss?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">It takes a second for me to realize he is talking to me. It&#8217;s as if the farmer and his complaint no longer exist.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Uh, yes. I&#8217;d like to buy an awl. The best you have.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, those are in the stockroom. I&#8217;ll be right back. Anything else before I go?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I look at the chain in the farmer&#8217;s hands. &#8220;Yes. I actually need a piece of chain like that one. How long did you say it is?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The farmer looks startled. He takes his hat off to me and lowers his eyes. &#8220;It&#8217;s two feet, ma&#8217;am. Two feet, seven inches.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I smile brightly. &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s perfect. That&#8217;ll chain my granddaddy&#8217;s shed door perfectly!&#8221; I turn to the clerk and frown just as darkly as my smile had been bright. &#8220;Oh, but you said you&#8217;re out of that chain, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The clerk hesitates. &#8220;That&#8217;s right. But we&#8217;ve got other types of chain in the back.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, no. That one was the perfect size. Well, that&#8217;s too bad. Maybe I&#8217;ll wait and buy the awl and the chain together somewhere else.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Evidently, there is a second hardware store in town, because the clerk suddenly looks inspired.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I tell you what. Old MacIntyre here was just about to trade in that piece of chain for some nails, weren&#8217;t you, boy?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">MacIntyre has the dignity not to nod. He just stares at the store clerk, who goes a bit pale beneath the glare.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t we do this, then. Give me that there piece of chain, boy, and pick out the nails you need. A quarter pound. Not an ounce more, mind you, and we&#8217;ll call it even. And ma&#8217;am, you can have your chain and your awl right here, easy as pie. That is, if you don&#8217;t mind a chain that&#8217;s been touched by a nigger.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I smile brightly again, but this time, it doesn&#8217;t reach my eyes. &#8220;I guess it&#8217;ll have to do.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">MacIntyre shakes his head and drops the chain on the  counter. The clerk watches over him as he measures out a quarter pound of nails. It bothers me enough that I clear my throat. &#8220;I really am in a bit of a hurry,&#8221; I say.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, of course.&#8221; The clerk takes a last look at the farmer and hurries back to the stockroom.</div><div class="tx">MacIntyre takes his time filling the little paper sack with nails, but when he is done, it weighs exactly a quarter of a pound. He puts his hat back on and nods without looking at me. I do my best to ignore him, like a white lady should, but I can&#8217;t help a little smile.</div><div class="tx">He passes close to me as he leaves the store. In a voice so quiet I barely hear him, he says, &#8220;Child, you gonna get yourself killed, or worse, doing what you&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I look at him in surprise and I know that he sees me for what I am&#8212;a colored girl playing at being white. My stomach twists and I feel my cheeks start to burn. I look up and the stock boy is standing in the aisle, watching us. The old farmer takes the chain off the counter and drops it into my hands. &#8220;Get on out of here, now,&#8221; he says. The door swings shut behind him, bell chiming as it closes.</div><div class="tx">My heart pounds in my ears and I drop the chain. The jangle of metal makes the stock boy jump. He rushes to pick it up, but his eyes are on me. I feel cold. And now this skinny little white boy is staring at me like an ape in the zoo.</div><div class="tx">The clerk abruptly reappears, all smiles, with my awl. His face falls when he sees the chain on the floor.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Damn it, Henry,&#8221; he says to the stock boy. &#8220;Sorry, ma&#8217;am. Watch your step there. I&#8217;ve got that awl for you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I can&#8217;t reply for fear that my voice will shake, and then what will this white man think? The stock boy, Henry, puts the chain on the counter.</div><div class="tx">I swallow hard. Move, Ida, before the stock boy says anything. But my legs feel weak. Killed, or worse, the farmer said. I stumble on a knot in the wooden floor and have to catch myself.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; the clerk says with concern, &#8220;are you all right?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No . . . I . . . I . . . &#8221; I fumble through my purse for my money. Calm down, Ida, I plead with myself. He&#8217;s just a stock boy. Even if he did hear what the farmer said, he&#8217;s a kid. I&#8217;m a woman. A white woman. Just stick with it.</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s harder than any flight maneuver I&#8217;ve ever peformed, but I manage to find my wallet and pay hurriedly, sweat on my brow, my hands shaking. &#8220;Thank you.&#8221; My voice comes out in a dry whisper.</div><div class="tx">The clerk frowns. &#8220;I can call a doctor for you&#8212;&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No! I&#8217;m fine, just fine.&#8221; I force myself not to glance back at the stock boy as I rush past him and back outside into the cool December air. I can&#8217;t hear anything over the sound of blood rushing in my ears. My face is hot. Every moment in the open street feels dangerous. It takes all of my willpower not to break into a run.</div><div class="tx">Suddenly, Patsy and Lily are there.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;There&#8217;s our girl,&#8221; Patsy exclaims. But one look at me brings a frown to her face.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, no! Are you sick, Ida?&#8221; Lily asks out of concern.</div><div class="tx">I shake my head. &#8220;No, no. Just tired.&#8221; My voice is high with strain.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You poor dear, you do look exhausted. Let&#8217;s get her home.&#8221; Patsy steers us toward the car where the other girls are waiting.</div><div class="tx">Their concern soon fades into talk of the holiday to come. I take my seat in the back and smile when necessary, but it&#8217;s  a false smile. Not until we reach the gates of Avenger Field do I start to breathe again. Sweetwater isn&#8217;t safe for a colored girl like me. One word from that stock boy, or the farmer, or someone else who can see me for what I am and I&#8217;m finished. Texas isn&#8217;t kind to coloreds. Grandy tried to tell me that. From now on, I&#8217;ll stick to the base. But inside, I know even New Orleans won&#8217;t be the same for me anymore. I&#8217;ll only feel safe in the sky.</div></body></html>';

The trick, I&#8217;ve discovered, is concentration, just like sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool. I&#8217;ve got to climb into the cockpit and picture the sky outside around me. It&#8217;s better than the Link, where there is no wind tugging against the wings. No, when you&#8217;re under the hood in a real airplane, you can&#8217;t see the sky, but you can feel it. I feel safe. My breathing is steady. I even smile sometimes, though no one can see it.</div><div class="tx">Jenkins sends me up for my first solo instrument flight. This is the last hurdle between intermediate and a long-distance senior solo flight, then graduation. Lily comes with me as my navigator. There&#8217;ll be no instructors to save our skins on this trip. She sits behind me, reading the maps strapped to the leg of her zoot suit with a small flashlight. I keep both hands on the throttle and both eyes on the control panel in front of me. It is dimly lit, like starlight, but with practice, I can read it plain as day.</div><div class="tx">We&#8217;re flying in broad daylight. It&#8217;s eleven o&#8217;clock in the morning, civilian time. Two days before Christmas. But so far as we can tell, it&#8217;s midnight outside.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Having fun yet?&#8221; Lily asks me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Boy, and how,&#8221; I reply. I still sweat a little when the hood  first closes, but once we take off, once we&#8217;re in the air, I settle back into the routine.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We make a good team,&#8221; Lily says, and feeds me the coordinates for our next maneuver. Jenkins has us flying around in a big zigzag. Other WASP are stationed here and there throughout the area with binoculars. Once they spot us, they radio back in. We radio when we think we&#8217;re over them, and then Jenkins gives us the green light for the next leg of the trip.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We do,&#8221; I agree. &#8220;What are you going to sign up for after commencement?&#8221; I ask. It no longer feels like a jinx to talk about graduating. We&#8217;ve made it this far, we&#8217;ll make it all the way.</div><div class="tx">Lily laughs through the speaking tube. &#8220;I was going to ask you the same thing.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hmm. Target towing sounds kind of dull,&#8221; I confess. &#8220;I was hoping to sign up for ferrying detail. That way, I&#8217;d get to fly every type of plane we have.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s what I was thinking. Patsy says she wants to test pilot. I was sort of hoping we&#8217;d all end up at the same place.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The thought of our little trio breaking up gives me a moment&#8217;s pause. &#8220;I guess I hadn&#8217;t really thought that far ahead.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We fly silently for a while. For the first time since leaving New Orleans, I think about life after Avenger Field. I gave up Jolene to be here. And a lot of the girls I&#8217;ve met at Avenger have washed out or gone home of their own accord. Melanie Michaels was not the last. Deatie Deaton was right&#8212;more than half of our original class is gone. I don&#8217;t want to give up Patsy and Lily, too.</div><div class="tx">Lily announces we&#8217;ve reached our second target area. I radio in our location and circle while Jenkins signals back the okay. Lily directs me to the next target.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;d be a shame to break up a team like ours,&#8221; I say finally.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Then don&#8217;t. I propose a pact. These two musketeers, at the very least, will serve through this war together. And maybe we can get Patsy to join us.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I accept.&#8221; My smile is back. &#8220;Besides, give Patsy a few days of flying old patched-up planes and she&#8217;ll want back in the race with us.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; Lily says. &#8220;Test piloting isn&#8217;t as experimental and exotic as she thinks it is. At least, not all the time. Right?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Right.&#8221; I frown. &#8220;I think.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We&#8217;re here. Radio in.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I reach for the radio. Patsy will have to wait until we land.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Half an hour later we are on the ground.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Good work, ladies,&#8221; Instructor Jenkins tells us. &#8220;Right on the mark every time.&#8221; He puts that infamously warm hand on my shoulder. &#8220;See, Jones, you&#8217;ve come a long way.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I can&#8217;t help but respond whenever he compliments me. In spite of my better judgment, Walt Jenkins makes me feel happy inside. When I smile at him, my grin goes from ear to ear.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You too, Lowenstein,&#8221; he tells Lily.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; we both say.</div><div class="tx">Jenkins looks at his clipboard. &#8220;Oh, and one more thing.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We hesitate. His face is so serious, my stomach starts to sink.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ladies?&#8221; he calls out.</div><div class="tx">From out of nowhere, the rest of Flight One comes running, Patsy at the forefront, grinning like a maniac. They hoist us up onto their shoulders and bodily carry us to the wishing well in front of the ready room.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Congrats, ladies. You&#8217;ve made it!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">They toss us unceremoniously into the water. It&#8217;s the happiest moment of my life. Although the water&#8217;s barely knee deep, we cause enough of a splash to make me grateful for my tightly braided pigtails and all of my time in the pool. Without hesitation, I reach down to the bottom and scoop up a few lucky coins to give to Instructor Jenkins. Even after the other girls pull us out, I can&#8217;t stop laughing.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Christmas dawns cold and clear at Avenger Field. We have the day off. The cafeteria is decorated in red and green garlands that remind me of decorations in an elementary school. I&#8217;ve sent the awl off to Grandy, along with the chain and a new lock. Abel&#8217;s got two new pairs of wool socks for the winter. For Mama, well, I know she&#8217;s been praying over me and Thomas both, so I bought her a new hat for church. And for Thomas. Well, the last we heard, he was in someplace called Manila in the Philippines, south of China somewhere. I guess signing up for the WASP is the best present I can give Thomas. Anything to help him come home sooner.</div><div class="tx">Instead of joining the other girls for breakfast, I drag a chair outside to the Beach to be alone. In the soft silence between the barracks, my eyes lose focus as I try to picture my family&#8217;s usual early, messy Christmas mornings, with Mama frying ham in the kitchen, me making biscuits, and Abel hopping around in a pile of wrapping paper. Thomas usually had  some girl or other he&#8217;d beg Mama to let him go see that afternoon. Mama would say, &#8220;Christmas is for family,&#8221; but by three o&#8217;clock, she&#8217;d be glad to have him out of the house. The house was so full of noise and people on Christmas.</div><div class="tx">But today, it&#8217;s quiet as a grave out here between the bunk-houses. Too cold for the sunbathers to make an appearance. And at home, I know it&#8217;s just the three of them now, with our usual pile of presents dwindled down by the war effort. There will be no new silk stockings for Jolene or bicycle tires for Abel, and no candy canes.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Boy, you look long in the face,&#8221; Patsy says. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been staring at the clouds all day.&#8221; It&#8217;s true. I&#8217;ve been hiding out here. Bundled up in a coat and hat, I&#8217;m not exactly worried about getting too much sun today.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;With the planes grounded for the day, it was the only place I could think of to get some peace and fresh air.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t explain the sad face,&#8221; Patsy says.</div><div class="tx">I shrug. &#8220;Been thinking about my family, I guess.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy drags another chair behind her. She plunks it next to mine, sits on it backward, and joins me. &#8220;Oh, I gave that up a long time ago. But I do think about Mrs. Harper. And the boys at the air show. That was a great time for a while there. A really fun run.&#8221; Patsy holds up the scarf around her neck. It&#8217;s a nubby mix of purple and lilac.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Mrs. Harper made this for me during the last cold snap in Florida. She was everybody&#8217;s mother at the boardinghouse. You meet all kinds of people on the road, Ida Mae.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I nod, caught up in my own memories. It takes a moment for me to register her words. &#8220;Patsy Kake, that&#8217;s the first time you&#8217;ve ever called me by my Christian name.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy smiles at me and shrugs. &#8220;It&#8217;s Christmas. When else  am I gonna do it if not today? So, are you gonna sit out here all day, or tell me what&#8217;s on your mind, or neither? In which case we should go inside. There&#8217;s cocoa and coffee in the mess.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I laugh. &#8220;Hmm. Well, I guess I should make some sort of decision here.&#8221; I shake my head, at a loss for the right words. &#8220;Well. It&#8217;s just, we&#8217;ve been here for months now and it looks like we&#8217;re making it, Patsy.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My smile is wistful. She shares it with me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And I haven&#8217;t said it until now, because being a WASP means everything to me.&#8221; I hesitate. &#8220;Almost everything.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy&#8217;s face gets very serious, and I feel sad inside. &#8220;I miss my family,&#8221; I say.</div><div class="tx">Patsy stares at me for a long time.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, honey,&#8221; she says at last. &#8220;You really are green. It only hurts on major holidays. Besides, we&#8217;re your family now. Let&#8217;s find Lily and open presents. That always helps.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I can&#8217;t help but laugh at my own moodiness. &#8220;All right. As long as I can have marshmallows, too.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We get up and drag the chairs back to the door. &#8220;Marshmallows?&#8221; Patsy says in feigned surprise. &#8220;There&#8217;s a war going on, missy. We need those marshmallows to make bombs and fight the war!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The tension in my shoulders eases as the day carries on. There are Christmas carols in the rec room and a few games. Patsy gives me a handkerchief with the name Jonesy embroidered at the edge in the WASP uniform color, Santiago blue.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Something to remember us by,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Wipe the tears away at graduation in style.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily gives me a small bottle of perfume. &#8220;My mother swears by it,&#8221; she assures me.</div><div class="tx">As for me, I give Patsy a new red lipstick &#8220;for after the war.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Or just after finals,&#8221; she says with a wink.</div><div class="tx">And to Lily, I give a set of hairpins to help tame her curls.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, thank you, Ida. I&#8217;d be lost without at least seven bobby pins on either side. You&#8217;d think those turbans we wear eat them up, I lose so many of them.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">All in all, the evening is homey and wonderful. After a big meal of roasted chicken and mashed potatoes, we wander back to our bunks, singing &#8220;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,&#8221; with some of the lyrics confused.</div><div class="tx">No sooner do I sit at the foot of my bed than one of the beginning trainees comes to the door.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Is there an Ida Mae Jones here?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s me.&#8221; I stand up, wondering what it could be. I hope it&#8217;s not something at the administration building. Post-holiday meal, my khakis are wrinkled and my clothes are simply too casual to have to take into Mrs. Deaton&#8217;s office.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;There&#8217;s someone at the gate for you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; I don&#8217;t know anyone in Sweetwater that doesn&#8217;t live on base.</div><div class="tx">The girl shrugs, brown curls bouncing with the motion. &#8220;Don&#8217;t know. A nigger woman. Maybe your housekeeper?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She turns and leaves without another word. I do nothing but stare after her. Just nod and say nothing.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well?&#8221; Patsy says. &#8220;You gonna go see who it is, or do I have to?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Her words shock me out of my thoughts. &#8220;No, no. I&#8217;ll go. See you soon.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I hope everything&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Lily calls after me. &#8220;If our maid, Dorcas, showed up at base, I&#8217;d think it was the end of  the world,&#8221; she whispers to Patsy. Her voice carries in my ears as I go out the door. End of the world. What would be the end of the world . . . ?</div><div class="tx">In a rush, I realize who is at the gate and what it might mean. I break into a run, trying not to worry, not to think, just to get there.</div><div class="tx">The MP points to the side of the guardhouse. I slow down, take a breath, and turn the corner.</div><div class="tx">Mama is sitting there, on the little block of concrete that serves as a bench. She stands up when she sees me, and we stand there, looking at each other like each of us has never seen another human being before.</div><div class="tx">I&#8217;d forgotten how beautiful she is. Her warm coffee-colored skin seems so dark to me after so many months away from home. I reach out and touch her arm.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Mama,&#8221; I whisper.</div><div class="tx">Something, whatever it is that&#8217;s been building inside me all day, breaks in a great wave. I throw my arms around her, but she stops me. Her eyes dart over my shoulder, and I understand. The guard is watching us. I force myself to laugh and pat her on the back.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Mama Stella, how are you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Fine, fine, Miss Ida Mae,&#8221; Mama says in a voice so meek, so . . . Southern, it makes me feel sick to hear it.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What brings you to Sweetwater?&#8221; I ask, as lightly as I can. &#8220;Is my family all right?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Fine, fine,&#8221; Mama says in a high, wavering voice. &#8220;Your granddaddy sends his best and your baby brother, too.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Aware of the guard at our backs, we fall into the pattern of mistress and maid. Watching my mother play the role of servant, I feel a sour taste in my throat. I never meant for my own role-playing to bring her such humiliation.</div><div class="tx">I don&#8217;t know this guard. He gives us a suspicious once-over, the look of someone trying to earn his status. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; I tell him. &#8220;She&#8217;s our housekeeper.&#8221; The word burns my throat, but we can&#8217;t afford his wariness. &#8220;We won&#8217;t be long.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama and I both smile at him. At last, he nods and disappears into the booth.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;How&#8217;s Thomas?&#8221; I ask quickly.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, Ida Mae,&#8221; Mama says, her voice strong and warm once again. Her eyes fill with tears. She reaches into her purse and pulls out a letter.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;This came last week. From the army. They say that Thomas has gone missing. And you know, they don&#8217;t go back looking for colored boys.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My heart drops to my feet. &#8220;No.&#8221; I clutch Mama&#8217;s hand, still holding the letter. &#8220;No.&#8221; It&#8217;s like Daddy dying all over again. The world shrinks and it&#8217;s just me and Mama and fear and an agony of sadness. My heart stops beating. I can&#8217;t breathe.</div><div class="tx">Mama shakes my hand, brings me back to her. &#8220;Ida, listen to me. They don&#8217;t go looking for colored boys just because their mothers ask . . . but they might do it for you. You&#8217;re a white woman now, and you work for the army. If that means something, if that means anything, then use it to help Thomas.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My head spins. Could it work? What would I say? I can&#8217;t call him my brother. A family friend? The son of my maid? Would they see our shared last name and know I am passing?  Tears of shame sit heavily beneath my eyelashes. I feel like Judas to my own family.</div><div class="tx">She steps back. &#8220;Look at you. You look every inch the lady. I can&#8217;t claim to understand what you are doing, but the day this letter came, I felt so helpless. Grandy went into town to see what the local recruitment office could do. All they offered was help with funeral arrangements, like he was already declared dead.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Every day I collect bacon grease for the war, but it&#8217;s useless, isn&#8217;t it? We can&#8217;t fight the war with rationing stamps and canned vegetables. We can&#8217;t save our sons by planting gardens. No matter what they say, we can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s not enough. My boy could be dying overseas, and I will not sit in the kitchen waiting for them to send his body home.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She reaches into her purse again and pulls out a handkerchief. She wipes her eyes. &#8220;You do this one thing for me, baby. You help bring Thomas home.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I will, Mama.&#8221; This time, I don&#8217;t care if the guard is watching. I throw my arms around my mother and hold on to her like I&#8217;ll never let her go home. Tears flow down my cheeks, into her hair, onto her collar. She shushes me, like when I was little.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s gonna be all right, Ida Mae. Thomas is alive. I&#8217;d know otherwise. It&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">And I pray to God that it&#8217;s true. I pray for my brother to find his way to safety. I pray for the strength to make it through this war, through this year, through this night. Hour by hour. I repeat the words.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What&#8217;s that, honey?&#8221; Mama asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hour by hour, Mama. That&#8217;s how we&#8217;ll win this war.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama smiles at me. Slowly, we let go of each other until we are standing there again, staring like it&#8217;s the very first time.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What was it, that song you and Thomas used to sing?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I laugh, but it turns into a sob. &#8220;Shoo, fly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama nods. &#8220;That&#8217;s right. How&#8217;s it go?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I shake my head, smiling sadly. She knows exactly how it goes. &#8220;You&#8217;re not gonna make me sing it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama gives me a look, and I know better than to argue. She&#8217;s trying to make me feel better. I take a deep, shuddering breath.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Shoo, fly, don&#8217;t bother me. Shoo, fly, don&#8217;t bother me. Shoo, fly, don&#8217;t bother me. For I belong to somebody.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama joins me. &#8220;I feel, I feel, I feel like a morning star. I feel, I feel, I feel like a morning star . . .&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I turn around. The guard has come back out of the guardhouse. I smile and wave, but we stop singing. He shakes his head and goes back inside.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;d better go,&#8221; Mama says.</div><div class="tx">Suddenly, I have so much to say. She can&#8217;t leave me. &#8220;Where are you staying? Are you in town?&#8221; I think of how hard it must be to find a hotel for coloreds out here.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; Mama says. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ve got my train schedule right here. I&#8217;ll be heading back home in a few hours. I just needed to see you. And tell you about Thomas. This is the first Christmas we&#8217;ve all been apart.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I know.&#8221; I pause, feeling like anything else I say will be useless. &#8220;Did you get the hat I sent you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I did. I won&#8217;t wear it until you both come home again.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, Mama, I meant for you to enjoy it now. Wear it and think of me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama huffs. &#8220;Girl, I don&#8217;t need a hat to think of you. I never stop thinking about you or any of my babies. Now, finish up your work here and come home as soon as you can.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; I salute her.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Merry Christmas, Miss Ida Mae,&#8221; she says.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Merry Christmas.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I think we might stand here for hours, just to be together again, but the guard sticks his head out of the box, and Mama looks at her watch.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a train to catch.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She leaves the gate and climbs into a truck that I&#8217;ve only just now noticed has been waiting. Before I can even ask her who it is, I see the driver. An older, colored gentleman in overalls. It&#8217;s MacIntyre, the farmer from the hardware store. The man who saw right through me and made sure I knew it. I shiver at the memory of his warning.</div><div class="tx">Mama turns and nods at me. &#8220;Grandy knows folks all over,&#8221; she says. And they drive away into the night.</div><div class="tx">I stand there, bewildered, as they disappear into the deep black-blue of the nighttime grassland. It feels like a dream. And then I think of Thomas, and it becomes more of a nightmare. It&#8217;s several long minutes before I willingly leave the cold air of the gate to find my bed.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">&#8220;Is everything all right, Jonesy?&#8221; Patsy asks in a quiet voice when I reenter the barracks. I&#8217;ve missed lights-out. Everyone&#8217;s in bed except for Patsy and Nancy Howard, who is trying to read a book by flashlight three cots away.</div><div class="tx">Patsy sits up when I come in. The light from the bathroom casts a dim glow across the bunkroom floor.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No,&#8221; I whisper, and sit on the edge of her bed.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, who was it?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;My mother . . .&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I say it without thinking. Patsy looks at me, but I can&#8217;t read her face. Across the room, I can hear Nancy Howard sit up on her cot.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I thought that girl said there was a nigger out there,&#8221; Nancy hisses. She folds away the book she was reading and starts to stand up. My skin goes cold.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sit down, Howard,&#8221; Patsy says. Her voice is low, but still sharp enough to make Nancy hesitate. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see she&#8217;s upset?&#8221; Patsy puts her hand on my arm.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What happened, Ida?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;My mother&#8217;s maid came to tell me some bad news.&#8221; I take a deep breath and hate myself more than I ever thought possible. I shrug nervously. &#8220;She wanted my help.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I thought you were a farm girl,&#8221; Nancy snipes. &#8220;Must be some farm if your mother&#8217;s got her own maid.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I press my hands to my cheeks as if I can hold back my blush. I&#8217;m too rattled to lie well.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I said leave her alone,&#8221; Patsy snaps at Nancy. &#8220;So what if they have a maid?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I don&#8217;t know if Patsy really believes me, but if she doesn&#8217;t, she never lets on. Nancy Howard sits back down on her cot, but I can feel her eyes boring into me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What did she come to tell you, sugar?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I close my eyes and try to find the words. I will go to hell for this, I think. I should go to hell. My mother&#8217;s face looks back at me in the dark, my own mother who let me treat her like a servant just so she could talk to me. When the first tear  rolls down my face, I can&#8217;t tell if it&#8217;s for Thomas or for pure shame.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;To tell me her son is missing in the South Pacific. He . . . we grew up together.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy says nothing. She looks past me at Nancy Howard. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not on the receiving end of that look. Nancy sniffs and lies back down on her bed. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t take you for a nigger lover. Tough luck, Jones,&#8221; is all she says.</div><div class="tx">My face burns and I stifle a sob. Yeah. Tough luck.</div><div class="tx">Patsy takes my hand. Her fingers are still as cool as that first day we shook hands on the bus.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you mind her. You were raised with your mammy&#8217;s son. She was raised with snakes. What kind of help did she need?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Finding him . . . Do you suppose I can put a request in with Mrs. Deaton tomorrow?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sure, honey. If not, she&#8217;ll know what to do. Now, where&#8217;s that kerchief I gave you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What?&#8221; I blink up at her. &#8220;Oh . . . here.&#8221; I reach into my footlocker for the embroidered cloth and start to wipe my eyes.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, give it here. I&#8217;m gonna teach you something.&#8221; Patsy takes the handkerchief and ties one of the corners into a knot. &#8220;This is a worry knot. You&#8217;re a WASP now, and that&#8217;s a lot like being a carney. We&#8217;ve got to travel light, light bags, light worries. Tie up all your cares into this knot, Ida. It&#8217;ll be there for you when the war is done. You&#8217;ll untie it when that boy comes home. No point in carrying it on your shoulders.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She hands me back the handkerchief and I finger the little knot. It&#8217;s hard and tight, not likely to come undone anytime soon. That feels just about right.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you, Patsy.&#8221; I want to say more, but Nancy Howard is listening. All I can do is squeeze Patsy&#8217;s hand and hope she understands.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sure, kid. Good night.&#8221; She kisses me on the forehead and goes back to her bed.</div><div class="tx">After a long moment, I get up again and brush my teeth, wash my face, change into my pajamas, and crawl into bed.</div><div class="tx">Thomas has to come home. And so do I. Becoming a WASP was selfish. Selfish, stupid, and dangerous. God, Nancy Howard almost had me tonight, and in Texas, that could cost me my life.</div><div class="tx">All I could think of was wanting to fly. The war was just an opportunity. It wasn&#8217;t real. But it&#8217;s real now. It means my brother is missing. It means my mother has lost her husband and now maybe her son. And she came all this way, letting me treat her worse than a dog, just to tell me. To tell me what? That my world will never be the same again.</div><div class="tx">I tuck my knotted handkerchief under my pillow and try to let it take away my cares. I think of Abel, lying in his little bed hundreds of miles away, without even his mother to tuck him in on Christmas night. I make a promise to him. By next Christmas, I&#8217;ll be home to stay.</div></body></html>';

I wrote letters to the army and to the Department of War, but no one had answers for me. Russia has pushed into Poland and the U.S. is too busy organizing bombing raids over Berlin to look for one colored boy. Despite the organization I see every day, finding one missing soldier is like looking for a drop of water in the ocean. Weeks turn into months and, while the Allies are slowly making progress in Europe, there&#8217;s less news from the Pacific and we still have no word. I write my third letter home telling my mother, for all of her faith in me, I&#8217;ve failed her. The only thing I can still do right is fly. And training doesn&#8217;t wait. Before it seems possible, Lily, Patsy, and I are assigned our first cross-country flight. Pull this off, and we graduate when we return to Sweetwater. Then we&#8217;ll be WASP for real.</div><div class="tx">The cargo plane takes off into the cold February air with a chugging sound that reminds me of a train as it transports us back east to Philadelphia, where we&#8217;ll pick up a shipment of brand-new BT-13 Valiants bound for California. Patsy gives me a mock look of alarm. Despite my personal worries, we&#8217;re all excited about today. This is the real thing. The twelve of us sit facing each other, strapped in to low benches, all painted that wonderful army green. I&#8217;d swear the military has something against beauty. Sergeant Middleton would say the olive drab color is for camouflage, but this is an airplane, not a jeep.  Who ever heard of an olive green sky? As we pull off the runway, I grip my seat. Those butterflies I came into training with are back, but now the worry is all for my big brother. I feel the knot in my handkerchief inside my zoot suit pocket and sigh. The sky doesn&#8217;t quite feel like home, knowing Thomas is missing.</div><div class="tx">I look at my friends. Patsy is all grins. Her baby blues twinkle as she nods toward Lily. &#8220;Jonesy, look.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily sits across the plane from us, a dreamy look on her freckled face.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Penny for your thoughts,&#8221; I say, glad for a distraction. Lily startles.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh. I was just thinking, when this war is over, Harry and I will finally be married.&#8221; She leans forward excitedly, wisps of auburn hair escaping her turban. &#8220;You&#8217;ll both come to the wedding, won&#8217;t you? Mother&#8217;s planning a gorgeous affair at the Waldorf-Astoria. The ballroom there is as big as a football field. I won&#8217;t know most of the people she&#8217;s inviting, I&#8217;m sure. But if you two are there, it&#8217;ll be just fine.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t miss it for the world,&#8221; Patsy says. I don&#8217;t say anything. After the war, Jonesy would be welcome in any joint in America. But not Ida Mae Jones. My stomach sinks just thinking about it. Mama told me more than once&#8212;color is not a line you can cross back and forth over just as you please. I think about my dance with Walt Jenkins. When this war is over, where will I stand?</div><div class="tx">If Patsy notices my silence, she keeps her own counsel. We haven&#8217;t spoken about the night my mother came to the base since it happened. Telling her the whole truth would only make her an accomplice. She deserves better than that. Besides, if she suspects at all, you wouldn&#8217;t know it. If anything, we&#8217;re closer than we were before.</div><div class="tx">Lily claps, caught up in her own daydreams. &#8220;Oh, good. Patsy, I can&#8217;t wait to see you cut the rug in front of all those stuffy old society people my mother knows. Harry will just love you. And maybe we could go to the Palladium one night, too, and show you where we like to swing.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sounds swell,&#8221; Patsy tells her. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it, Jonesy?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Terrific.&#8221; I fold my hands in my lap. They&#8217;re getting cold at this high altitude. One thing at a time, Ida Mae. &#8220;First, we&#8217;ve got to pull this mission off.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You worried?&#8221; Patsy asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Why should she be? Ida&#8217;s the best navigator in the flight,&#8221; Lily says.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Not worried,&#8221; I admit. &#8220;Just ready. I want to graduate so badly I can taste it. Just to say, look at me. Look at all of us. Look at what we&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Amen,&#8221; Patsy says.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Good luck to all of us.&#8221; Lily shakes our hands with such solemnity that we all start to laugh. The flight to Philadelphia is a long one. We settle in and try to get as much rest as we can. No more energy spent on personal demons. The flight to California will be long and strictly solo. Just a girl and her machine.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">The Valiant is an everyman plane, a basic trainer every WASP checks out on as an intermediate. Flying one of these across country will be like making the trip with an old friend. Twelve planes are lined up in the hangar at Boeing&#8217;s Pennsylvania factory, just outside of Philadelphia. The City of Brotherly  Love is just a smudge in the distance across the ice-crusted river. I&#8217;d have liked a chance to see the Liberty Bell, but I&#8217;ll get plenty of sightseeing from the cockpit over the next few days.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;California, here we come,&#8221; Patsy says.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait!&#8221; Lily exclaims. Neither can I. It&#8217;ll be warm in California.</div><div class="tx">We&#8217;ve got our baggy flight suits on under fleece-lined leather coats, with our maps strapped to our right thighs. Flying in February isn&#8217;t exactly a warm proposition, even with an engine-heated cockpit. A quick briefing with the commanding officer at the plant confirms our orders. These planes are due in California at the Long Beach base by Wednesday. It&#8217;s Friday morning. The plan is simple&#8212;fly as fast and far as you safely can, taking whatever pit stops you need. We&#8217;ll meet up at designated sleep points along the way, but this isn&#8217;t a conga line. It&#8217;s every woman for herself, as long as we&#8217;re all there by twelve o&#8217;clock Wednesday afternoon. And if I know these ladies, we will be.</div><div class="tx">I do my flight check twice, annoying the engineer.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Lady, just get on with it. It&#8217;s a new plane,&#8221; he says.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I know that, mister. And I don&#8217;t care. This is my first real ferrying job. I&#8217;m not going to mess it up just because some 4-F flyboy didn&#8217;t fuel her up right.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">It was the wrong thing to say. The engineer glares at me. Some of these boys wanted to be pilots and didn&#8217;t cut the mustard. It must burn him up to see women behind the sticks of these planes. The colored parlor maid inside me wants to duck her head and apologize immediately, and I almost do, but the pilot part of me wins. I know I&#8217;m right. I&#8217;m following procedure. I take a deep breath. Being colored, female, or  both&#8212;none of that&#8217;s going to help me fly this plane safely to California. We finish the rest of the flight check in near silence. As it turns out, the plane is in perfect order. But now we both know it&#8217;s true.</div><div class="tx">I take a last trip to the restroom. There won&#8217;t be another bathroom break until Ohio, tonight. My mouth is dry, but a sip of water now could cost me a whole hour down the line.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll see you girls at the pit stop in Cleveland,&#8221; I say to everyone.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Cleveland?&#8221; Patsy calls from her own cockpit. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be in Gary, Indiana, by the time you make Cleveland.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I check my fuel gauge. It&#8217;s full to the top. &#8220;You&#8217;re on.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Patsy laughs. I pull my goggles on and taxi out onto the runway.</div><div class="tx">I never do get to see the Liberty Bell. Up here, above the airfield, I&#8217;m still too far away from the city to see anything properly except for my own frozen breath, let alone a bell in some building. But I don&#8217;t mind the cold or missing the city sights. There&#8217;s plenty enough to see from where I&#8217;m sitting. I circle the airstrip and test my wings. This bird is one sweet plane. With a last look back, I see the other WASP trainees taking off, one by one, like silver geese into the sky, and we fly west, away from the rising sun.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">&#8220;BT-13 to base, BT-13 to base. Permission to land.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The Cleveland tower controller&#8217;s voice crackles over my radio. &#8220;BT-13? Base to BT-13, where are you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I waggle my wings. &#8220;Southwest of the tower, Base. Over.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The fellow on the other end of the line sounds exasperated. &#8220;Base to BT-13. Sorry, but that&#8217;s a military name and all I see is a military plane. Are you in trouble? Over.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I have to stop myself from laughing. Our squadron leader, Audrey, warned us this could happen. &#8220;No, sir. I <i>am</i> that military aircraft. WASP trainee Ida Mae Jones, requesting permission to land. I need to use the facilities.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;A dame?&#8221; The controller does nothing to hide his surprise. &#8220;We&#8217;ve heard about you girls. Sure, come on down! I mean . . . permission to land granted. Take runway three, just north of you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I come into a landing smooth as ice cream and hardly wait for the wheels to stop rolling before I throw back the cockpit hood. Cleveland is my first pit stop, after all. I land with barely enough time to run to the first toilet I can find. Flying in layers of clothing to keep warm has its disadvantages.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Excuse me. Where&#8217;s the ladies&#8217; room?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The three soldiers that greet me on the tarmac blink in astonishment. &#8220;It really is a girl,&#8221; one of them says.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, a girl that needs to use the latrine. Where is it?&#8221; Funny how having to go makes you lose your manners.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Over there,&#8221; the second soldier says, pointing to a Quonset hut a few yards away. He hesitates. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not a ladies&#8217; room. I mean, we don&#8217;t have a place for girls.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I stare at him. &#8220;Then it will just have to do.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">It turns out, except for decor and cleanliness, men&#8217;s toilets work just the same as women&#8217;s. I wash my hands as quickly as I can, resisting the urge to splash some water on my lips. Patsy&#8217;s probably having a steak dinner in Indiana by now.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thanks, boys.&#8221; I wave as I run past my three soldiers and climb back into my plane.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Permission to take off,&#8221; I radio to the tower.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s that dame again,&#8221; I hear the radio controller whisper. &#8220;Yes, BT-13. Permission to taxi. Have a safe trip.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I take off into the blue sky again.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Two days later, weather and wind have blown the twelve of us as far as Nebraska.</div><div class="tx">I look at my charts for the umpteenth time. &#8220;We fly through the night, stop once to fuel, and we can still make it on time.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The other girls stare at me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s the only way we&#8217;re going to make it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Like hell,&#8221; one of the girls says. Her name is Mandy, a brunette with short curly hair and a pixie smile. She&#8217;s not smiling now. &#8220;At least truckers have caffeine. We can&#8217;t even risk a cup of coffee in these boats.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And that, ladies, is how the army will get rid of us,&#8221; Patsy says. &#8220;Men will always be able to fly farther than women.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Stupid relief tubes,&#8221; Lily says with a frown. Relief tubes are just what they sound like, tubes equipped for men to allow them to &#8220;relieve&#8221; themselves in mid-flight. They don&#8217;t exactly work for women. And so we stretch our bladders, go thirsty, and make do the best we can. Rumor has it that somewhere around Avenger Field, there&#8217;s a map of every ladies&#8217; room from sea to shining sea. Top secret, of course. Those are the first places they&#8217;ll look if a WASP ever goes missing.</div><div class="tx">We all laugh, and the tension of the last few days ebbs just a little. Patsy puts her map away and salutes the group of us. &#8220;Saddle up, girls. It&#8217;s time to stick it to them, right in the relief tube.&#8221; She squeezes my shoulder. &#8220;Be good, Jonesy.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You too, Pats. I&#8217;ll see you in Long Beach.&#8221; She smiles and waves goodbye. Steely-eyed as the dawn, we climb into our planes, ready to do our best.</div><div class="tx1">They tell you all kinds of things about night flying when you&#8217;re training in the Link. They tell you about star navigation if your instruments should fail and how to find your landmarks in the dark. They talk about the disorientation of the few minutes just before sunrise and sunset, when you don&#8217;t know how the light of the sun will hit you. It can be blinding and deadly.</div><div class="tx">What they don&#8217;t tell you is how to fight your body&#8217;s natural urge to shut down as the day closes. They don&#8217;t tell you how to keep from going stir-crazy with nothing but you and the occasional burst of radio information to keep you company. My mind drifts back to different things&#8212;our upcoming graduation, which commission to request. Thomas.</div><div class="tx">Mama risked the trip out to Sweetwater to tell me he&#8217;d gone missing. He could be dead or worse. Stories coming out of Europe tell me it can all be a lot worse than I ever imagined the world could be. I can&#8217;t stand to think of it, knowing there&#8217;s nothing I can do. Maybe I should have gone home with Mama right then and there. But if I finish this mission, I&#8217;ll be sending Thomas one more plane to fight for him in the Pacific. I cast around the sky but see no sign of the other WASP. Even if I&#8217;m the only one on schedule, this is one plane that will get to him on time.</div><div class="tx">My thoughts turn to my mother and little Abel, Grandy and his tractor parts, Jolene and her dancing shoes. I miss them terribly when I think of them, so I try not to. It&#8217;s a mistake, I know. Lily invited me to her wedding after the war. But right now the war seems like it will never end. We&#8217;re losing ground overseas, and the enemy is gaining. Then again, if  it all ends tomorrow, so does my reason for passing. Like Cinderella after midnight, I go back to being colored. And <i>that</i>  Ida Mae Jones, the real Ida Mae Jones, could never go to Lily&#8217;s wedding as anything other than a serving maid. I&#8217;ll never have another dance with Walt Jenkins. I&#8217;ll never know what it&#8217;s like to be more than just his trainee. I won&#8217;t even be able to tell people back home I was in the WASP. Or I could make the other choice and stay white. No home, no family. Simple as that.</div><div class="tx">It makes me wonder what we are fighting for. But then I have to shake my head to clear it and remember. Thomas. I am fighting to bring Thomas home.</div><div class="tx">The sun rises behind me, lighting up the California landscape as I come in over the San Gabriel Mountains. The phrase &#8220;purple mountain majesties&#8221; takes on new meaning for me. It&#8217;s beautiful. As the morning grows bright and warm, I feel the cobwebs of worry clear from my mind.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;California.&#8221; My voice sounds funny, my throat and tongue are too dry. But the word is sweet. &#8220;California. California. Woo!&#8221; I let out a whoop that cracks before it&#8217;s over, but it is a whoop nonetheless. I&#8217;ve made it. I&#8217;ve made it. Wednesday morning dawns clear but windy. I don&#8217;t care. I rub my eyes and take a closer look at my maps, pointing the way to Long Beach.</div><div class="tx">I land to little fanfare. I am the first of the WASP to arrive. The commanding officer sends for me, and we exchange the paperwork for the airplane.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;These will be camouflaged, packed up, and shipped overseas within the week,&#8221; the CO tells me with the pride of a man who loves his operation.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s been nice doing business with you.&#8221; We shake hands, and I return to the tarmac to see the arrival of the rest of the girls.</div><div class="tx">Lily and Mandy land an hour later, almost at the same time. &#8220;We both got lost over Arizona,&#8221; Lily tells me. &#8220;I saw Mandy circling and caught up to her. We&#8217;d still be out there if not for each other.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Three more girls come in, then five. Eventually, everyone is accounted for, except for Patsy.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s almost twelve o&#8217;clock,&#8221; I say. &#8220;Another few minutes and she&#8217;ll be officially overdue.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, that doesn&#8217;t affect the rest of us, does it?&#8221; Mandy asks. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a group grade. Is it?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily frowns. &#8220;I&#8217;d be more worried about our classmate, if I were you,&#8221; she says angrily.</div><div class="tx">I <i>am</i> worried. &#8220;Where could she be?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Anywhere between here and Nebraska,&#8221; Lily says. She starts to pull out her map and stops.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Remember how late she was on her flight test with Martin?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I do remember. How worried we had been and for nothing. &#8220;You&#8217;re right. She&#8217;s always got a reason. We should just relax and wait.&#8221; But this time, Happy Martin&#8217;s not riding shotgun with Patsy, slowing her down. Anxiously, we wait on the bench outside the ready room, scanning the sky for any sign of her.</div><div class="tx">At exactly one minute to noon, a silver BT-13 appears in the sky over the control tower.</div><div class="tx">I wave up to the plane, unsure if Patsy can see us. The wind has picked up since we&#8217;ve been here. Patsy&#8217;s Valiant buffets a little in the wind.</div><div class="tx">She waggles her wings. By the looks of it, her permission to land is granted. Patsy circles the base in her beautiful machine and comes in for a landing.</div><div class="tx">As the wheels touch down, a spray of fluid arcs out from the plane, catching the sun in a rainbow of fuel and engine oil. The plane skips back into the air, up, then down, hard. The fuselage smashes against the asphalt ground, showering sparks into the sky like angry fireflies.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Patsy!&#8221; We shout her name and run toward the crumpled plane, still skidding full tilt down the airstrip.</div><div class="tx">A siren starts whining in the distance and a bell signals the arrival of a fire truck. I pray that it won&#8217;t be needed.</div><div class="tx">Patsy never stops. Her plane skids right to the end of the runway, where it collides with a lone outbuilding and bursts into flames.</div><div class="tx">I feel the heat of the explosion on my face. This shouldn&#8217;t be happening. It can&#8217;t be.</div><div class="tx">The fire trucks are there. I can&#8217;t run any closer. The flames are too hot, too high. Lily&#8217;s hand is on my shoulder, and we stop and stare, watching Patsy&#8217;s plane burn.</div></body></html>';

At least, that&#8217;s what the counselors tell me here at the base. Audrey Hill recommended Lily and I talk to one of the counselors after Patsy&#8217;s accident, seeing as how we were such close friends. Lily went readily enough. As if talking to a stranger might help. Mama taught me a long time ago that colored folks deal with their sorrow in their own way. My way has always been to hide it, turn it into something else. That&#8217;s how it was after Daddy died, when all I wanted to do was hate everyone I loved so they couldn&#8217;t leave me hurting the way Daddy did. I never exactly ran away, but I was gone in my head, up in the clouds, flying away from everything. I was gonna soar straight up to heaven to meet him one day. That was the plan of a sixteen-year-old girl.</div><div class="tx">I&#8217;m not sixteen anymore.</div><div class="tx">In the end, it took Walt Jenkins telling me he couldn&#8217;t let me back in a plane without a psych evaluation that made me go see Doctor Monserud. He&#8217;s a medical doctor, but he also deals with head problems. I didn&#8217;t want Walt to worry about me or, worse, to think there was something wrong with me&#8212;so I went.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s natural,&#8221; he tells me. &#8220;It&#8217;s natural to feel angry. And scared, and sad.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I don&#8217;t say anything, but I nod and get through it. Doc Monserud&#8217;s a nice fella, but he doesn&#8217;t know a thing about me being sad. I can&#8217;t tell him how hard it is to deny my own  brother so I look like I belong here, how scared I feel knowing Thomas is missing and maybe dead. What it was like to leave Mama, Grandy, Abel, and Jolene way behind, not just miles, but color lines away. Or what it&#8217;s like to lose Patsy. The only girl here who might have accepted me, no questions asked, if I&#8217;d had the guts to really tell her the truth.</div><div class="tx">So, I sit there, and I nod, and I let enough of my sadness show that the doctor thinks I&#8217;m healing the right way. And I leave his office and go back to the barracks to take a shower so hot it&#8217;s like to peel my skin away. And after the hot water&#8217;s run cold, I get out, get dressed in my Santiago blues, and take a minute to tie a second knot in my handkerchief, hard and fast for Patsy. Time enough to grieve later. For now, I&#8217;ll travel light, because today is graduation day. I am going to be a full-fledged WASP.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Even the death of a comrade can&#8217;t dampen the mood of most of the girls lined up here. Row upon row of cadets, in deep blue pantsuits, just waiting for silver wings to be attached to their crisp white blouses, over their hearts. We look like the airplanes do, lined up and waiting in the yards in Delaware to be picked up and flown across the land. Lily squeezes my hand quickly. It feels small and cold in mine.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Patsy&#8217;s smiling at us,&#8221; she says, nodding toward the perfect blue sky.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;So is Jackie Cochran.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily blinks and drops my hand. &#8220;Where?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Over at the grandstand.&#8221; Even I feel my spirits lifting a little. After Bessie Coleman and Amelia Earhart, Jackie Cochran is my hero. It was Jackie Cochran who convinced Uncle Sam to form the WASP in the first place.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Why, she&#8217;s so small,&#8221; Lily says. I laugh.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;So are we.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I know, but . . .&#8221; I know what she means. Jackie Cochran is a living legend, but she can&#8217;t be much taller than I am. She&#8217;s beautiful, of course. With a cosmetics company of her own, she should be. What you can&#8217;t tell from looking at her, though, is that she came from nothing and made more than something of herself. She&#8217;s the bee&#8217;s knees.</div><div class="tx">Jackie Cochran was born to poor folks in Florida. She came from the dirt and grew up to run her own company. She also married a man smart enough to let her fly. Jackie holds more flying trophies than any woman alive today. And I&#8217;m going to shake her hand.</div><div class="tx">Tears suddenly spring to my eyes. I don&#8217;t know who I miss more right now, Patsy or Daddy. They both have that same fiery spirit as Mrs. Cochran. If Patsy had known she&#8217;d be here . . .</div><div class="tx">She&#8217;d what? Have checked her plane twice before the last leg of our flight? She would have somehow known that the fuel line had a leak? She did know. That&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve been saying. That&#8217;s why it took her so long to come in. She was low on fuel and flying safe, lower to the ground in case she needed to land. She should have flown the way she used to. Maybe she&#8217;d have made it. Maybe she could&#8217;ve wing-walked her way out of the plane before it burned.</div><div class="tx">But I know it&#8217;s not true. When she landed, the spray of oil must have blinded her, made her bounce the landing, sparking the fuel line. Nothing can outmaneuver a fire that fast. Not even Patsy Kake.</div><div class="tx">Lily clears her throat, and we all sing &#8220;Silver Wings and Santiago Blue.&#8221; Jackie Cochran tells us she is proud of all of  us, all of &#8220;her girls,&#8221; as she puts it. She mentions Patsy, not by name, but as a &#8220;sacrifice,&#8221; one we are all willing to risk.</div><div class="tx">I wish she had just said her name.</div><div class="tx">One by one, we all file up to the stage, and Deatie Deaton hands our silver wings to Mrs. Cochran, who pins them on us. It&#8217;s an honor for her to be here at all. She&#8217;s been busy fighting for military status for the WASP back in Washington. If she wins, girls like Patsy will be sent home with military honors, on the military dime. Instead, Lily is paying for Patsy&#8217;s funeral. She wired her mother the day after the accident and made arrangements. Mrs. Emily Harper down in Florida was the closest thing Patsy had to a family. Lily and I will attend the funeral after graduation, and then we have a week at home before reporting to duty at our new assignments.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Congratulations, Miss Jones,&#8221; Jackie Cochran says to me. She shakes my hand, and hers is warm and firm, like Patsy&#8217;s. I can&#8217;t help but wonder if she&#8217;d shake it if she knew I was a Negro.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; I say, cool as November. Inside, I&#8217;m all mixed up. I want to shout, I want to cry. I want to be happy, but it&#8217;s as bitter as it is sweet. I descend the steps from the stage, my silver wings glinting at my collar. I&#8217;ve done what I came to do. Abel won&#8217;t believe it. I know I hardly believe it myself.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s it, girls. Introducing class 44-W-3. Congratulations, ladies. You&#8217;re WASP now!&#8221; Mrs. Deaton announces. The place erupts in cheers, applause, and a few unladylike whistles.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;All we need are mortarboards to toss in the air,&#8221; Lily says, reminding me of my high school graduation.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;My mother wouldn&#8217;t let me throw my cap,&#8221; I tell her. &#8220;She was afraid it would get dirty, and she wanted to save it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, we&#8217;d better keep our hats on now, too, then,&#8221; Lily  says. &#8220;Mother knows best.&#8221; Judging from the hats tossed into the air around us, not everyone would agree.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">That afternoon, we leave Avenger Field behind with a dusty kind of sorrow. I know the minute our bus passes through the gates that it will never be the same place for me again. Other WASP used to come through on ferrying missions now and again, and they always had the same sadly bemused look when they saw the place. I didn&#8217;t understand it until now. It&#8217;s like that saying &#8220;You can never go home again.&#8221; Only I am going home, as soon as we bury Patsy. And I hope it will be the way it was before I left.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Florida is as green and lush as it is back home in Louisiana; the air is thick and slow here. You can even hear it in the drawls of the people at the bus station. Mrs. Emily Harper is no exception. She sounds like the Southern belles you hear in the movies, not in the real South. All the same, she is kindly. She greets Lily and me at the station. She&#8217;s dressed in an ocean green skirt suit. We shake hands and make pleasantries like we&#8217;re at a church social when all I want to do is hug this woman that Patsy thought of as a mother and a friend. But not now. There&#8217;s business to attend to.</div><div class="tx">Two station workers, little colored boys that can hardly be called men, struggle with the box that now holds Patsy&#8217;s remains. I am reminded that all the able-bodied men are overseas. Or closed up in coffins, like Patsy. The thought makes me shiver, even though the day is hot. Please, God, don&#8217;t let there be a coffin for Thomas.</div><div class="tx">The streaming sunlight makes everything feel like swimming in slow motion. The sounds of farewells, greetings, and baggage being hauled fade away and grow tinny as we follow Patsy&#8217;s casket from the station platform to the borrowed truck outside.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Undertaker couldn&#8217;t make it today. Too many funerals,&#8221; Mrs. Harper explains. She introduces us to the driver of the truck, a worn-looking little man with a too-large face and ruddy cheeks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Mr. Evanston here is on his way through from Mississippi. He&#8217;s staying the weekend in town, offered the ride.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you kindly, Mr. Evanston,&#8221; I say, and shake his hand.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Miss.&#8221; He nods in that polite way you don&#8217;t get from Northern men.</div><div class="tx">We pile in and ride straight to the funeral parlor. Evidently, the undertaker can spare just enough time to take Patsy inside. We give him her best dress and Mrs. Harper offers her own earrings for her to be buried in.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Please,&#8221; Mrs. Harper says, and hands the undertaker&#8217;s men a small cloth bag. &#8220;I wore these on my wedding day. Pearls. She always fancied them on me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The undertaker clears his throat. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, ladies, but this is a closed casket funeral. Please, keep your jewelry.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mrs. Harper hesitates until Lily rests a hand on her arm. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Mrs. Harper. Patsy wouldn&#8217;t want you to give them up.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The older woman nods, even though she doesn&#8217;t quite understand, but I do. Lily and I saw the flames that devoured Patsy&#8217;s plane. There&#8217;s nothing left of her to dress up. Still, the undertaker takes the dress we gave him to make us feel better.  I close my eyes for a moment so I don&#8217;t cry in front of everyone, especially Mrs. Harper.</div><div class="tx">Lily and I both fall silent for the rest of the ride to the boardinghouse. Some things just can&#8217;t be said.</div><div class="tx">When we arrive, Mrs. Harper shows us upstairs to Patsy&#8217;s old room. &#8220;We had a fella staying in here, but he was more than glad to move when I told him you were on your way. Now, make yourselves at home. I&#8217;ve got supper to fix. We sit down at five thirty. I hope you&#8217;ll join us.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Lily says, the first words she&#8217;s spoken since we left the undertaker&#8217;s. Mrs. Harper shuts the door behind her just as softly as if we&#8217;d been sleeping babies. The room is comfortable and larger than I would have expected a boardinghouse room to be. The walls are papered in a powder blue with tiny pink rosebuds here and there. Two beds fill the room, one a full, the other a tiny single pressed up against the wall of the front of the house. A window over the single bed looks down to the street below. No one is out in the yard. Lily drops down onto the little bed as if the life&#8217;s gone plumb out of her. I know how she feels.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, dear.&#8221; I sit across from her on the bigger bed. Every ounce of me feels tired, as if the heat and sorrow are more than a soul can bear.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I want my mother,&#8221; Lily says.</div><div class="tx">I go sit next to her and put an arm around her. &#8220;So do I.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She rests her head against mine and quietly, I start to sing. &#8220;Amazing Grace.&#8221; Daddy&#8217;s funeral song. The song Mama was humming when I decided to join the WASP. I sing it softly, and then the words just turn to a hum. Lily sighs and I stop  feeling so numb, a little at a time. And somehow we are able to make it through the sit-down dinner at five thirty, and through the rest of the night, and through watching our best friend lowered six feet into the ground the next afternoon, when the only place she ever wanted to be was in the sky.</div></body></html>';

The trains look different in wartime from when we&#8217;re at peace. Most of the men at the stations and even here on the train are in uniform. Or old, or only boys. And the women, they travel in groups, some with children, eyes wide and eager for reunions or red with saying goodbye. After Patsy&#8217;s funeral, I kept on my dress blues; the pantsuit makes for easier traveling than a skirt. My silver graduation wings are still on the lapel. I&#8217;ll take it all off soon enough. Mama, Grandy, and Abel are waiting for me on the other end of this track. It&#8217;s been five months, and I&#8217;m finally going home.</div><div class="tx">A smile tugs at my lips, but my stomach drops. Thomas is still missing in action. My daydream of a family reunion has an empty spot where my big brother should be. Mama will be angry with me. I promised I would find him, but those promises led nowhere.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;First seating for lunch, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; The porter bows politely. I rouse myself and follow a handful of other passengers to the narrow whites-only dining car. Coloreds don&#8217;t get dining cars on most Southern trains.</div><div class="tx">The porter gives me my own booth, with red velveteen upholstery and scratched china plates. I order a bowl of tomato soup, then rest my cheek on the cool glass of the window and close my eyes. How can I eat when Thomas is  missing? And Patsy . . . I shake my head. I don&#8217;t want to think about Patsy.</div><div class="tx">Three months Thomas has been missing, lost somewhere in the Pacific. I say a little prayer over my lunch. Please help my brother stay alive. After a few minutes, I give up on my soup and return to my seat two cars away.</div><div class="tx">Through the window, Georgia gives way to Alabama in a haze of thick green trees. The air is heavy down here. Even with the windows open, I feel the humidity, like the sky is trying hard not to cry.</div><div class="tx">Or maybe that&#8217;s just me.</div><div class="tx">The woman across from me glances at my uniform. She has green eyes set in a face so pink, she looks like a baby doll. She sees me looking back at her and smiles, a pinched smile. Maybe I remind her of someone. Or, more likely, she&#8217;s thinking of the stories she&#8217;s heard about the kind of girl that would join a man&#8217;s army. I shrug. I&#8217;ll change out of uniform tomorrow and go back to being Ida Mae Jones. In the meantime, I&#8217;m proud of what I am, a Women Airforce Service Pilot. A WASP.</div><div class="tx">I smile at the thought and stick my nose out the window. The wind rushes by and lifts my hair off my face. It feels good. Almost like flying. For a moment, I can forget the sore spot in my heart. I need every moment like this I can get.</div><div class="tx">I sleep sitting up through Alabama. In the morning, as the train leaves Mississippi, I take my duffel and walk the length of the cars until I come to the door marked COLOREDS at the back end of the train. I find the ladies&#8217; room between the two cars and slip inside. I&#8217;ll leave the train as a colored girl&#8212;Grandy will be waiting for me.</div><div class="tx">The room is more of a broom closet, with a small sink, a short metal toilet, and a mirror on the wall. I straighten my blue uniform in the mirror, wipe away a bit of lint, and touch the cool silver metal of the wings on my lapel. It looks right on me, against my pale skin and soft brown hair. It makes me feel older than just twenty years. But only white women can wear them, and New Orleans is just an hour away. Time to turn back into a pumpkin.</div><div class="tx">With a sigh, I open my bag and pull out my civilian clothes, a travel suit of soft brown-and-cream-flecked summer wool. The next time I look in the mirror, I&#8217;m no longer a WASP, young and white, able to fly. Same pale skin, same soft hair. But now I can pass for colored, just another light-skinned girl.</div><div class="tx">Someone knocks at the door. I let them knock. I wait in the toilet until I feel the train come to a stop and the conductor announces we&#8217;ve arrived in New Orleans.</div><div class="tx">Only when I hear other people moving from both cars do I close my bag and unlock the bathroom door. I exit the train in a crowd of both coloreds and whites. If anyone recognizes me, they won&#8217;t know me for the white woman I was when I boarded the train.</div><div class="tx">Grandy is waiting for me outside the train station, away from the segregated platform. The old yellow pickup truck with its deep, rusting bed and slumped seats is a welcome sight. But not as welcome as my grandfather&#8217;s coffee brown face. I grin at him and walk over. He nods at me and grabs my bag.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know what color you&#8217;d be when I saw you, so I thought it best to let you decide,&#8221; he says seriously.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Grandy!&#8221; I scold him with a swat on the arm. &#8220;Where&#8217;s  Mama and Abel?&#8221; I ask. &#8220;I thought they&#8217;d be here.&#8221; I can&#8217;t hide my disappointment. Maybe Mama hasn&#8217;t made peace with my new life, the way I hoped she would.</div><div class="tx">Grandy shakes his head. &#8220;Your mother&#8217;s back at the farm,&#8221; is all he says. It worries me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Any news about Thomas?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Grandy shakes his head again and I can feel my heart sinking. It&#8217;s not a real homecoming without all of us there.</div><div class="tx">The rest of the ride back to Slidell, Grandy tells me small news, stories of the folks about town, how the farm is doing, and the like. I tell him what fun training has been, what the graduation was like. I&#8217;m careful to say nothing about Patsy. As much as I want to talk about my friend, I know what happened to her will only scare Mama. And from the looks of it, that&#8217;s the last thing I can afford to do.</div><div class="tx">We pull off the main highway, down our old dusty road, and my shoulders relax. It&#8217;ll be harvesttime in a couple of months. The strawberry fields are getting thick with fruit, and the shutters on our old yellow house still need painting. The porch is empty, but the windows have been thrown wide open to catch the breeze. I put my hand on Grandy&#8217;s arm as he shifts the truck into park.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Lord, it&#8217;s good to be home.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Grandy smiles at me, that strong, white-toothed smile. After a minute, I follow him out of the truck.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Leave it for later,&#8221; he tells me when I go to get my bag from the truck bed. It makes me hesitate.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What&#8217;s going on, Grandy?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What do you mean, baby girl?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I stop, and my hands go to my hips, just like Mama&#8217;s do. &#8220;I mean, I have never in all my livelong days heard you say  &#8216;leave&#8217; anything for later. In fact, I&#8217;ve been switched for saying as much myself.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Grandy frowns at me, and I think I&#8217;ve gone too far. &#8220;Young lady, I am still your grandfather. If you know what&#8217;s good for you, you&#8217;ll get inside.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He shakes his calloused hand at me, a sweeping motion that gets my feet moving again, even though my luggage is left behind. Up the front steps that echo hollow as a good mush melon, through the screen and wooden front doors, and into the foyer I go.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Mama? Abel? I&#8217;m home,&#8221; I call. I&#8217;m disappointed that they aren&#8217;t waiting for me, but I&#8217;m so glad to be home, I try to be patient.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m home,&#8221; I say again, more quietly.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;About time, too,&#8221; says a voice. A man&#8217;s voice.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thomas?&#8221; I run into the parlor. Plain as day, there is my big brother, laid up in Abel&#8217;s narrow little bed. It must&#8217;ve taken two men to bring it downstairs. Thomas grins at me, and his face, half Mama&#8217;s, half Daddy&#8217;s, is so beautiful, so perfect, I almost don&#8217;t see the wince of pain when he waves or the bandages on his arm and chest.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Tommy!&#8221; I run toward him to throw my arms around his neck and hug him tightly.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Easy, girl. Your brother&#8217;s got enough broken on him without you breaking anything else,&#8221; Mama says. The words are stern, but she&#8217;s laughing.</div><div class="tx">Suddenly, I see the whole room clear as day. Mama is there, right next to the bed, and a gangly kid stands on the other side of him. A gangly kid, whom I recognize as my not-so-little brother Abel.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh my God!&#8221; Instantly, I gasp. You don&#8217;t take the Lord&#8217;s  name in vain in Mama&#8217;s house. But this time, no one seems to notice.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thomas, Abel! Look at you!&#8221; Five months can change a little boy almost as much as two years can change a man.</div><div class="tx">I turn to Mama and laugh. &#8220;I must be Rip Van Winkle! How long have I been gone?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Grandy comes in from the hallway, his hat in his hands. &#8220;Long enough for the military to do their dern jobs and find your brother.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And long enough for Abel to have a growth spurt or two,&#8221; Mama adds with a grin.</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s too much. I want to hug everyone, I want to laugh, and I want to hear everything. Instead, I burst into tears.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Clayfoot,&#8221; Thomas says, patting my arm with his good hand. &#8220;We&#8217;re home now. Everybody&#8217;s home.&#8221;</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">After dinner, when Abel&#8217;s gone off to catch fireflies with the neighbor boys and Grandy&#8217;s gone to bed, Thomas shows off his broken hip, the pin in his ankle, and tells me the story of his tour of duty.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;The Philippines are something else, Clayfoot. Hotter than a down-home July, most of the time. My first night, the mosquitoes were so thick, it was a wonder we all didn&#8217;t come down with malaria. We were at the back of a platoon of colored soldiers, not really going anywhere, just holding our ground, keeping this particular island away from the Japanese. We were treating dysentery and fevers; jungle diseases, not war wounds. And then, one night, bang! Like a bolt of lightning hit the place. Next thing I know, I&#8217;m hearing Japanese.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Thomas laughs and points to himself, lying on Abel&#8217;s bed in the living room in his pale blue striped cotton pajamas, the  buttons winking pearly and bright. &#8220;They caught me with my pants down, Ida. Too hot to sleep in pj&#8217;s, I was in my boxers when the Nips came. And I was lucky. Of all the personnel at the hospital, only two of us survived.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">In the kitchen, I can hear Mama humming as she puts the dishes away.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Tommy.&#8221; I put my hand on his leg. It&#8217;s just like it used to be, me sitting on the foot of his bed, a big cup of warm milk in my hands, listening to stories when I couldn&#8217;t sleep. Only now, I&#8217;ve got stories of my own to tell when the time comes.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;They tortured us, Ida, something fierce. Didn&#8217;t even want information. Just wanted to listen to us scream, I think.&#8221; He looks at me with hooded eyes. &#8220;They&#8217;d never seen Negroes before. We were a novelty, like damn circus elephants. They didn&#8217;t believe I was a doctor. Didn&#8217;t believe I could be.&#8221; He looks off in the distance. The night is soft around us. &#8220;Who knows, Ida? Maybe it saved my life.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Then one day, American planes started flying overhead. We were in the jungle pretty deep, but they found us. Some of the other boys I was with were killed in the rescue. But the guys who pulled us out didn&#8217;t know they were rescuing anybody. They were just hunting Japanese. Said the Japs blew up our hospital when they took us. It was such a mess, they thought everybody was dead.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Thomas rests his head back on the goose down pillows Mama&#8217;s plumped up all around him.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I came home just as soon as I knew the trip wouldn&#8217;t kill me. Don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll ever run again . . .&#8221; He trails off and pats his hip. We&#8217;re both thinking about him running to save Daddy. <i>Look at Thomas fly</i>. I put my hand over his and he sighs. &#8220;Looks like I&#8217;ve got about a month&#8217;s worth of healing  left.&#8221; He grins at me. &#8220;My own prognosis. But that&#8217;ll probably be down to two weeks with Mama on duty.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I grin back. &#8220;She was so worried about you. She&#8217;ll fix you up right and then love you to death, but she&#8217;ll take good care of you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Thomas shakes his head. &#8220;Don&#8217;t I know it. Remember that time I fell off the barn trying to catch swallows?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yeah. And you call <i>me</i> Clayfoot.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Thomas laughs. It makes him suck in a little air. &#8220;Ribs are still bruised. And broken,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;Just like when I fell off that roof. Mama sat up with me around the clock until I could breathe without flinching. The only reason she&#8217;s not in here right now is because you are.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Good,&#8221; I tell him. &#8220;She could use the break. And so could you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t say &#8216;break.&#8217;&#8221; He groans.</div><div class="tx">We both laugh. I take a sip of my milk and am reminded of Lily trying to calm herself before our flight test.</div><div class="tx">Thomas reads something in my face. &#8220;Now, what&#8217;s this about you joining the army?&#8221; he asks. &#8220;I thought you were going to stay here on the farm.&#8221;</div><div class="tx"><i>Like I asked you to.</i> He doesn&#8217;t say it, but I hear it just the same. The wind leaves my lungs. I denied Thomas was my brother so I could stay in the WASP. He&#8217;s watching me, but I can&#8217;t meet his eyes.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t think I don&#8217;t remember what you said,&#8221; I tell him.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I tried to stay, I really did. But the news coming back from overseas was worse and worse, and it was just so hard, sitting on my hands, waiting for you to come home. So I joined the fight the only way I could.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;By pretending to be white?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My stomach aches. It sounds so outlandish to hear him say it.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Abel showed me this article one day, about Uncle Sam looking for women who could fly. Suddenly, it was like everything Daddy taught me about flying was for a reason. A good reason, too.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Thomas is quiet, but I&#8217;ve found my footing again. &#8220;I&#8217;ve flown from Philadelphia to California. I even learned to swim.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You? Swim?&#8221; Thomas looks impressed in spite of himself. Then he shakes his head. &#8220;That&#8217;s great, Clayfoot. But Mama needed you on the farm.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, she wanted me at home, but she didn&#8217;t need me, Thomas. She doesn&#8217;t need much of anything. Between her and Grandy, this place runs like a Swiss clock. And Abel&#8217;s got more friends all the time. No, it was just me and Jolene cleaning the Wilson house, collecting cans and panty hose.&#8221; I twist my fingers together, as twisted as my tongue feels. &#8220;You just wouldn&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Thomas smiles. &#8220;Sure I would, Clayfoot. It&#8217;s like standing in that field out there, too small to pick the tractor off Daddy and too slow to get help in time.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My breath catches in my throat. I look at my brother, and old tears rise to the surface of my eyes. Thomas has always blamed himself for not being able to save our father. That&#8217;s why he wants to become a doctor. Kind of like me becoming a WASP when I couldn&#8217;t save Thomas. But I still couldn&#8217;t save him.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I agree. &#8220;Like that.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And you wish you could do more,&#8221; he says quietly.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Thomas sighs. &#8220;The only difference is, you <i>can.</i> And you are. But it&#8217;s a dangerous thing you&#8217;re doing, Ida Mae, playing white. I&#8217;ve been in this man&#8217;s army. I hate to think what&#8217;ll happen if they figure out you&#8217;re colored.&#8221; He shakes his head, and I think of what I&#8217;ve already done in the name of passing.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Tommy, I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221; I grit my teeth to keep from crying. God help me, I&#8217;ve lied so many times over to join the WASP, and I know I&#8217;ll keep doing it, as long as they let me fly.</div><div class="tx">Thomas shrugs. &#8220;Still, I&#8217;m proud of you, Clayfoot. I think about the sight of those planes flying over that prison camp, and I know that they were there because of girls like you. And I couldn&#8217;t be prouder.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I laugh, a choking sound, and feel like I can breathe again. &#8220;Stop messing with me, Thomas.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, I know better than to mess with a WASP.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I swat him, and he swats back. Maybe he understands. Maybe this is his forgiveness.</div><div class="tx">Mama comes into the room. &#8220;Ida Mae, don&#8217;t make me tell you again. You&#8217;ll break that boy beyond repair.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;He started it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I don&#8217;t care who started it.&#8221; Mama gives us her best &#8220;there&#8217;ll be trouble in this house&#8221; look, hands on her hips, dish towel still in her hand. &#8220;It&#8217;s finished now.&#8221; And then she smiles. &#8220;Lord, it&#8217;s good to have you home. Now you can both be home to stay.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Thomas and I look at each other. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been honorably discharged,&#8221; he explains apologetically.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh. Well. I&#8217;m just getting started.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Thomas nods, as if to say, &#8220;I know.&#8221; But Mama doesn&#8217;t look happy.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Mama, I&#8212;&#8221; She leaves the room without a word.</div><div class="tx">Thomas and I sit there in silence. I know better than to go after her now. If I do, I&#8217;ll be asking for permission to leave, and she didn&#8217;t really give it to me the first time. She certainly won&#8217;t now. But I have to go back. I have to report for duty.</div><div class="tx">Thomas squeezes my hand.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Clayfoot. You know she&#8217;s proud of you, don&#8217;t you? All she could talk about once she was done talking about me was you.&#8221; He laughs and shakes his head. &#8220;I must admit, I didn&#8217;t know you had it in you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I raise an eyebrow. &#8220;Well, Brother Thomas, there&#8217;s more where that came from.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Now Thomas laughs even harder. &#8220;Boy, we&#8217;re in trouble now.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I find myself laughing, too. I&#8217;ve got six days at home. I won&#8217;t ruin them by arguing with Mama now. It can wait. It will have to.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s past my bedtime.&#8221; I stand up and stifle a yawn.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You&#8217;re kidding?&#8221; Thomas says. &#8220;It&#8217;s six A.M. in Manila right now.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s bedtime in Slidell. I&#8217;ll see you at breakfast. Good night.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He pulls me in for a one-armed hug. &#8220;Good night.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I mount the stairs, hearing the familiar sounds of the house creaking around me. Abel is asleep in his room on a cot Mama used to keep in the attic but deemed too springy for Thomas to convalesce in. I tiptoe into Abel&#8217;s room and kiss my bean-pole little brother good night.</div><div class="tx">Back in my own bed, the ceiling is too low. I miss the barracks, believe it or not, and the open cockpits of our trainer planes. I close my eyes and pretend I&#8217;m simply flying at night, with the glowing instrument panel my only guide. It helps.  My thoughts drift to Lily in her apartment, ten stories above Manhattan&#8217;s Fifth Avenue, and Patsy in Florida, unable to wear her landlady&#8217;s wedding pearls. Patsy Kake. I sit up and dig around in my suitcase for my knotted handkerchief. I undo a knot for Thomas and feel lighter for it. Patsy was right. It helps to travel light, but some things you just can&#8217;t leave behind. Those are my last thoughts, and then I fall asleep.</div></body></html>';

Look at you, look at you!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene hollers from down the block. I wave and she rushes down the street toward me, still in her cleaning clothes, a satchel in one hand and sweater in the other.</div><div class="tx">We&#8217;re outside of Miss Mary&#8217;s three-chair beauty parlor, built into the side of her house. The long white wooden building has merliton vines growing in the side yard. Jolene drops her bag when she reaches me and I sweep her into a hug.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;ve missed you so much,&#8221; I tell her, breathing in the familiar smell of pine cleaner and Cashmere Bouquet soap. Her scent is a sudden anchor to my old life.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;ll say.&#8221; Jolene pulls back. &#8220;You&#8217;ve put on some weight.&#8221; She pinches my arm. &#8220;But it&#8217;s solid.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Calisthenics,&#8221; I say.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;But you look pale as a ghost, Ida Mae. Don&#8217;t they let you see the sun out there?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I smile weakly. I don&#8217;t want to talk about skin color. &#8220;Come on, Miss Mary&#8217;s waiting.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene and I are going to the picture show on Canal tonight. It seems plenty of sailor boys are making their way through New Orleans while heading toward the Gulf of Mexico, and Jolene wants us both looking good.</div><div class="tx">Miss Mary is a smiling woman with round glasses and a flair for the latest hairdos. She waves at us as we come in and  rises from the card table where she&#8217;s been doing a crossword puzzle. I breathe in the sharp smells of straightening lye, newly pressed hair, and memories. Miss Mary gave Abel his first haircut when he was three.</div><div class="tx">The shady room is a welcome change from the sun-bright street outside. We settle into the pink hair-washing chairs, with their neck rests low against the black sinks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;How you been, Ida Mae?&#8221; Miss Mary asks me as she rinses down my hair. Miss Mary loves doing my hair. &#8220;Smooth as silk and easy to press,&#8221; she says. Today, she runs her fingers through it, smiling at me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Haven&#8217;t seen you in a while. People&#8217;ve been talking.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I look at Jolene. She shakes her head and rolls her eyes. Of course there would be rumors, and Mama&#8217;s not one to bother with gossipers. She&#8217;ll just say, &#8220;None of your business,&#8221; which only leads to more speculation. &#8220;What kind of talk?&#8221; I ask.</div><div class="tx">Miss Mary shrugs and her young assistant, Eliza, turns her head to hide a smirk. &#8220;It&#8217;s just that good girls don&#8217;t disappear from home for months at a time.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene starts to say something, but I beat her to it. &#8220;Good girls, Miss Mary?&#8221; I tilt my head to look up at her. &#8220;You think I&#8217;m not?&#8221; I can feel the heat rise in my face. &#8220;Do I look like I&#8217;ve been off having babies?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">At the next sink, Eliza shrugs. &#8220;Or not having them.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Eliza Brown, that is enough,&#8221; Miss Mary says sharply. &#8220;Now, I&#8217;m sorry, Ida Mae. I think the world of your mama, so I think the world of you, too, but you should know that people are talking, and a lot of that mess is said right here. So, what should I be telling them?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I&#8217;m too angry to speak. Jolene didn&#8217;t tell me there was gossip to worry about. From her chair, she gives me an apologetic shrug. Miss Mary sighs. &#8220;Listen, child, I&#8217;m trying to help. Anything I say, they&#8217;ll believe. For a while, at least.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I take a breath. Mama did try to warn me. Jolene did, too. &#8220;Tell them I&#8217;m in the army.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You enlisted?&#8221; Eliza whirls around to look at me, eyes wide with something like respect. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that, Ida Mae. Good for you. They got a lot of colored nurses in the army now. Some of them even working on white men.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene catches my eye and raises an eyebrow enough to let me know that any rumors were moved along by Eliza here. So, let her fill in the blanks any way she sees fit.</div><div class="tx">I shake my head and change the subject. &#8220;Thomas is home.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank the Lord for that.&#8221; Miss Mary relaxes visibly. She ties on her apron and soaps up my hair. &#8220;We&#8217;ve lost too many good boys,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Glad to see one of them come home alive.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">At the next sink, Eliza gets to work on Jolene. &#8220;Danny Taylor came home last month,&#8221; she says in her high, young voice. I brighten to hear Danny&#8217;s name. I remember his strong bright smile that day Jolene and I saw him doing roadwork. The day before we went to war.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;He came back in so many pieces, they said they&#8217;d have to have two funerals to fit them all.&#8221; Eliza chuckles nervously. I gasp.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Lord, whatever happens,&#8221; Miss Mary said. &#8220;One of them minefields or airplane bombs. His mama&#8217;s lucky to have any piece of him back.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My heart sinks to my feet. &#8220;Jolene, did you know?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene stays quiet for a long time. &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; she says at last. &#8220;I went to the funeral.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The sunny mood of our afternoon is dampened, and we sit through the rest of our hair washing in silence. It&#8217;s not until we are under the dryers that Jolene perks up again.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;So, tell me everything. Starting with height.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Her hair is a nest of combed-out curls and mine still in curlers. She&#8217;s only halfway through her styling process, and I&#8217;m practically done with mine. The two of us are completely alone in the back of the salon. Even shouting over the hair dryers, no one can overhear us. Not even Eliza with her big old gossip-hearing ears.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What do you mean, height?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, how tall the men are, of course! A man in uniform always looks taller to me, like all that extra starch Uncle Sam&#8217;s been using in the laundry gets into their backbones.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I shake my head. Jolene is as boy crazy as ever. Not even a war could change that.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s not like that,&#8221; I tell her. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t any men stationed at the field anymore, outside of instructors, and it&#8217;s strictly forbidden to mix it up with them.&#8221; I don&#8217;t tell her about my dance with Walt Jenkins. That would scandalize even Jolene. I wish I <i>could</i> talk to her about him, though. I wonder what she&#8217;d think of him if he wasn&#8217;t white. My face flushes just thinking about it. Ida Mae, you have to watch your step, I remind myself. I didn&#8217;t join the WASP to find a white man.</div><div class="tx">Fortunately, Jolene&#8217;s not looking at me. She frowns and flips through her copy of <i>Woman&#8217;s Day</i> magazine. &#8220;Girl, I thought you&#8217;d been having yourself some fun. Just marching around and flying airplanes sounds dull, dull, dull, dull, dull.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not. I like it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Mm-hmm. And how are the girls? Are white army girls as snooty as civilians?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No. Well, not all of them. I&#8217;ve made some really good friends.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Right,&#8221; Jolene says, and I know what she&#8217;s thinking. Good friends as long as I&#8217;m white. But a real friend would accept me even if they knew the truth. Or would they? I frown. It&#8217;s a question I haven&#8217;t got an answer to. But I do know that I won&#8217;t tell Lily the truth while we&#8217;re still in the service. If I got found out, we&#8217;d both be in trouble. But maybe afterward, when all of this is over . . .</div><div class="tx">I sigh. We&#8217;ll just have to see.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;They really are good people, Jolene. You would have liked my friend Patsy. She&#8217;s . . . well, she was a lot like you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What do you mean &#8216;was&#8217;?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My face gets hot, but it&#8217;s killing me not to talk about it. &#8220;Oh, Jolene. She died on our last flight. Mechanical failure.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene drops her magazine and throws her hood of the dryer up.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I thought you was flying planes. You never said anything about dying.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I close my eyes. I shouldn&#8217;t have said anything, but Jolene is my best friend. I wanted her to know. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t tell my mother. It&#8217;s not anyone&#8217;s fault if it happens. I&#8217;m careful, as careful as anyone can be.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Jolene shakes her head. &#8220;You&#8217;re a fool, Ida Mae. At least when a girl passes for white down here, it&#8217;s to have a better life. Not to end up dead. You are a colored girl, no matter how high yellow you look or how white you act. The army don&#8217;t even know who your family is. If something happens to you,  you think they&#8217;ll write a letter to some colored folk so we can collect the body?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Seems like everybody around here is so busy telling me I can&#8217;t that they won&#8217;t spare a minute to say I can, and did, do what I said I would,&#8221; I snap. &#8220;You can&#8217;t take it away from me, Jolene. Even if you&#8217;re jealous. Even if your skin&#8217;s so dark all you&#8217;ll ever be is a housemaid. No, don&#8217;t worry about me. I&#8217;ll be just fine.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The ladies up front are watching us now. Apparently they  <i>can</i> hear something. Eliza is leaning forward to listen better, and Miss Mary looks worried. My cheeks are burning with anger and embarrassment. I lift up my hair dryer and feel my curls. They&#8217;re dry enough. &#8220;I&#8217;m done here.&#8221; I stand up. Jolene watches me with hurt in her deep brown eyes.</div><div class="tx">Well, I&#8217;m hurt, too.</div><div class="tx">Jolene shakes her head again and goes back under the dryer. I pick up my own magazine and walk to the front of the shop, where Miss Mary sets me down to style my hair.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Everything all right, baby?&#8221; she asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Everything&#8217;s just fine.&#8221; The angry lava inside me is already cooling down, turning into a lump of cold pride. And regret. But all I want to do is go home.</div><div class="tx">It feels like a lifetime before Miss Mary tells me my hair is done. Jolene is still under her dryer, her face hidden by a magazine. &#8220;Please tell Jolene I&#8217;ve gone home,&#8221; I ask Miss Mary.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Of course, darling.&#8221; She lets me out of the chair and grabs a handful of my curls. &#8220;Such good hair,&#8221; she says, smiling. &#8220;Such good hair.&#8221;</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">When I get home, I find Mama in the kitchen, making drop biscuits to go with the chicken she&#8217;s roasting. There&#8217;s a pile  of mustard greens on the table. I wash my hands in the kitchen sink and sit down in front of the greens without a word, glad to stop using my head for a while. Jolene&#8217;s got me so turned around, I don&#8217;t know which way is up. I wish the army had taught us how to navigate feelings as easily as they did a starless night sky.</div><div class="tx">Mama&#8217;s new Fiestaware bowl, the one that looks so much like jade in the afternoon light, fills slowly as I sift through the greens, sliding my fingers down the spines, breaking off the tough, soil-heavy stems. Greens should go down smooth, not rough and hard to chew. The sharp, spicy smell of the leaves sprays the air. Mama just keeps mixing her biscuit dough. We fall into the rhythms of the kitchen so easily it&#8217;s a wonder I&#8217;ve ever been away.</div><div class="tx">Mama hasn&#8217;t said much to me since my first night back. If things were different, she&#8217;d know something was wrong now and ask me about it. She&#8217;d give me advice on what to say to Jolene, tell me how friendship is more important than pride. But her silence is stubborn and I don&#8217;t know if she&#8217;d take her own good advice right now. Not when she&#8217;s set her mind otherwise. That&#8217;s something I guess I learned from her.</div><div class="tx">I remember how she was when Daddy left her, still pregnant with Abel, and went off to Chicago to learn to fly. Mama wore black that whole five months and acted like she&#8217;d been widowed. Daddy hated knowing she was dressed that way. Said it was like a flower putting on a hat, covering everything pretty. Daddy was back before Abel was born, but Mama never really forgave him.</div><div class="tx">I shake my head at the memory. Funny to realize that when she actually became a widow, Mama only wore black once, at  the funeral, and then never again. Maybe she thinks Daddy&#8217;s watching his flower from heaven now.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hey, Ida.&#8221; Abel comes bounding into the kitchen, his arms full of strawberries. &#8220;Found these at the far end of the field,&#8221; he says with a grin. &#8220;Mama, can I have a bowl?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You know where they are,&#8221; she says, shaking her head. Mama&#8217;s back is turned to us, but I know she&#8217;s smiling just the same.</div><div class="tx">Abel pulls out his shirt from the bottom with one finger, making a hammock, and dumps the berries from his arms into the cloth.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Abel,&#8221; I warn him.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Young man, if that stains, you&#8217;ll be bleaching it out yourself,&#8221; Mama says, turning around from her biscuit dough for the first time. The white batter clings to her fingers in little peaks. Abel giggles and reaches over the counter for a bowl.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You said get a bowl,&#8221; he insists. Lucky for him, there&#8217;s nothing but a little dirt left on his shirt. He shakes it off into the garbage pail and rinses the berries under the faucet.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Can we save some biscuits for shortcakes?&#8221; he asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now, where do you think I&#8217;m going to come up with cream just so you can have shortcake?&#8221; Mama asks him, moving to the sink herself to wash her hands.</div><div class="tx">Abel shrugs. &#8220;I thought it&#8217;d be nice. Ida&#8217;s home.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama glances over at me for the first time. Her face softens. &#8220;That&#8217;s a fine idea, Abel,&#8221; she says to him. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see what we can do.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thanks, Mama.&#8221; Abel smiles at both of us and tears out of the kitchen just as fast as he came, in the way that only young boys do.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe how big he&#8217;s gotten,&#8221; I say, watching those long, jackrabbit legs carry him out of the room.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Three children, and I never get used to how fast you all have grown up,&#8221; Mama says. She towels her hands dry on her apron and opens the oven to baste the chicken.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Another hour on dinner,&#8221; Mama says. She puts her biscuit dough in the icebox. Nice thing about drop biscuits. You don&#8217;t have to worry about them rising.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s see about that cream.&#8221; Mama reaches for a coffee can on top of the icebox, where she keeps her rationing coupons, and sits at the table.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some snap beans in the icebox that could use some cleaning, if you got the time,&#8221; she says.</div><div class="tx">I&#8217;ve got the time, all right. Jolene isn&#8217;t going to want to see a movie with me now, or ever. Maybe even if I had the words to apologize. &#8220;We having snap beans or greens tonight?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Put the mustard greens on,&#8221; Mama says. &#8220;There&#8217;s salt meat in the icebox to season them with. The beans are for tomorrow.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I find the big pot Mama uses for greens and drop a few pieces of the pink-and-white salt meat into the bottom with the greens. Mama&#8217;s cooking up a storm, but today I&#8217;ve lost my appetite.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;ve missed you, Ida Mae,&#8221; Mama says out of the blue.</div><div class="tx">I join her at the table with the bag of green beans. &#8220;I&#8217;ve missed you, too, Mama.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We work in silence for a while, me with my green beans and Mama shuffling through her stamps looking for a coupon for a pint of cream.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going downtown with Jolene tonight?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; I swallow around the lump in my throat. &#8220;Not tonight.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama stops her shuffling and looks up at me. &#8220;What did you girls get up to?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I shrug, but Mama knows how to get an answer out of me. She sets her elbows on the table and gives me a stare that says she&#8217;s got all the time in the world.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We got into it over nothing,&#8221; I say. But it isn&#8217;t nothing, really. It&#8217;s everything. &#8220;She&#8217;s mad at me because I&#8217;m passing and she can&#8217;t.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama raises an eyebrow. &#8220;Is that what she said?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I think about it and shake my head, getting angry all over again. &#8220;No. What she said was I&#8217;m a fool, a fool for thinking I can be a WASP. But I&#8217;m not, Mama. I&#8217;m doing it, no matter what anyone says. I know you think I should come home, but I can&#8217;t. They need me to fly just as much as any of you need me here.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama laughs sharply. &#8220;Baby girl, Uncle Sam doesn&#8217;t need you. Uncle Sam doesn&#8217;t need anyone in particular. He just takes whoever he can get and tosses them up to the slaughter.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Mama, don&#8217;t start.&#8221; I drop the snap bean in my hand into the bowl.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Somebody needs to. Somebody needs to talk some sense to you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I stand up from the table. &#8220;I thought you understood, Mama. When you came to see me at the base, when you risked everything to tell me that Thomas was missing, you said you were proud of me. I thought you finally understood why I wanted to be a WASP. Are you saying that&#8217;s all over  now that Thomas is back home? Now we can let the country fend for itself, let all of those other sons and brothers find their own way back home because we&#8217;ve got ours?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama is standing now, too, and for the first time I realize we are both exactly the same height. She stares me down with those brown eyes, nostrils flaring, as if to say, &#8220;Girl, don&#8217;t you take that tone with me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">But she doesn&#8217;t say it.</div><div class="tx">Instead, she looks at me hard and says, &#8220;Ida Mae, people are dying. Women are dying. You think I don&#8217;t read the paper? Every time there is an airplane crash reported, I think of you. Do you think I don&#8217;t wonder if maybe, on this or that stormy night, you&#8217;re up there flying in the lightning and the hail? Just the way I worried about Thomas overseas, trying to save those boys from dying in the swamps and the heat.&#8221; She comes toward me, grasping my hand in both of hers.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Baby, I don&#8217;t care if you come home and clean houses or even if you run off like your daddy&#8217;s people and pass for white in some town I&#8217;ve never seen. But I want you to be safe. Safer than I can keep you if you go back and fly for the army, your country, or any other reason. I want my little girl to live.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I stare at my mother for a long time, and suddenly, I can&#8217;t keep the truth from her. &#8220;My best friend died last month, Mama. It was awful. Worse than I can say. She knew something was wrong with her plane, but there wasn&#8217;t a thing she could do about it. I watched her come in for a landing, all wrong, but there wasn&#8217;t anything else that could be done. And when her wheels hit the ground, it sparked the fuel tank and . . . I&#8217;ve never seen such a ball of fire.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama pulls me into the hug that I&#8217;ve been wanting ever  since that awful day. &#8220;Her name was Patsy, Mama. Patsy.&#8221; I cry on my mother&#8217;s shoulder, and she holds me the way she used to. I don&#8217;t feel so tall anymore, standing in the kitchen with her arms around me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Mama, I get so scared sometimes. But then I feel so free when I&#8217;m up there, like nothing can go wrong. I know it does sometimes. I know it does. It&#8217;s dangerous, but life is dangerous, isn&#8217;t it? You&#8217;ve heard the news, the same as me, Mama. This war is bad. If it reaches our shores, who knows what will happen? I can&#8217;t let fear stop me. Not when there&#8217;s so much in this world to be afraid of.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Mama pulls away from me and holds me at arm&#8217;s length. &#8220;Baby girl, I&#8217;m sorry about your friend. But I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll do if it happens to you. Thomas being back home is a miracle. I don&#8217;t know if God will give me another one.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I feel such misery, I can only look at my mother and think again about the high cost of war. Why should she have to pay?</div><div class="tx">Just then, Abel comes running back into the room. &#8220;Grandy got some cream from Mr. Brandy&#8217;s cow. Mr. Brandy said we could have it if we bring him a shortcake.&#8221; He&#8217;s excited, out of breath, and so carefree he seems to float across the linoleum toward us. Mama wipes her eyes with her apron and turns to him.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, isn&#8217;t that nice?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Can I have a pitcher?&#8221; he asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Of course. Now, thank Mr. Brandy for me.&#8221; She moves to the cabinet and pulls down a small jug.</div><div class="tx">I sigh and pick my bowl of snap beans off the table.</div><div class="tx">Abel passes me on his way out. &#8220;Your hair looks pretty, Ida Mae.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thanks, Abel.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He grins and is gone.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Supper&#8217;s in half an hour, Abel,&#8221; Mama calls after him. Just like that, we fall back into the kitchen rhythms and stop all talk of war.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Coming home isn&#8217;t what I thought it would be. I come down to help with lunch on my last day and the tension that had broken between Mama and me is back. She moves slowly through the kitchen, making sandwiches, not quite looking at me. She knows I&#8217;m leaving, but she&#8217;s more sad than angry about it now. Rather than sit with that sorrow, I tell her I&#8217;m not hungry and head outside to be alone. Jolene isn&#8217;t talking to me ever since that day at the hairdresser&#8217;s. My face grows warm with shame just thinking about the things I said to her. But I don&#8217;t know how to take them back. I&#8217;m not even sure if I want to. Maybe both of us were wrong.</div><div class="tx">No, home isn&#8217;t what I thought it would be. I don&#8217;t know what I was expecting. A parade, a party, or a reception like those people sitting on the hoods of their trucks out at Baker&#8217;s Pond gave us. But not this.</div><div class="tx">I walk out into the strawberry fields. When I was young, I would lie on my back at the edge of the field and look at the clouds. Today, I just keep walking. On the other side of the field, past the tree line, is a little stream. More of a ditch, really. We used to fish for crawdads in the mud there, when Daddy was still alive. I go there now and find a good rock to sit on. The clouds skid by overhead on the spring breeze.</div><div class="tx">God, I wish Daddy was here. He understood me. At least, I like to think he did. We grow up into people our families don&#8217;t always recognize. Like little Abel, whose growth spurts  make him look like a basketball player now, and Thomas, who used to be so big and strong, suddenly bedridden and weak. And me, I don&#8217;t even know if I&#8217;m colored or white anymore. Ida Mae Jones or Jonesy. I want to be them both.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida, Ida Mae!&#8221; Somebody&#8217;s hollering after me. I slide off my rock and rest my back up against it. If I&#8217;m lucky, they won&#8217;t see me from the other side.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Girl, don&#8217;t be hiding from me. I can see you just the same!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Shoot. I peek over the rock. Grandy&#8217;s coming toward me, an oily rag in one hand, a tractor engine part in the other. I don&#8217;t know if that old thing&#8217;s actually ever broken or if he just likes taking it apart.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sorry, Grandy. Just looking to be alone for a little while.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Grandy comes up to me, sweat on his brow, his overalls a patchwork of dirt and grass stains. Aside from his hands and his work clothes, Grandy is the cleanest man I&#8217;ve ever seen.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Plenty of time to be alone on the way back to Sweetwater,&#8221; he tells me.</div><div class="tx">I smile at him, but it&#8217;s a sad smile. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m going back.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Grandy looks at me like I&#8217;m the fine print on a city lawyer&#8217;s contract. &#8220;Of course you&#8217;re going back.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He turns and walks back through the trees, toward our strawberry fields. I have to jump up to catch up with him.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I want to, but Mama&#8217;s against it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Grandy shakes his head. &#8220;The two of you are more like sisters than mother and daughter. Twins, at that.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He turns around to face me. &#8220;Ida, you&#8217;ve been hardheaded for far too long to stop now. That&#8217;s your daddy in you, and your mama, too. And if there&#8217;s one thing I know, you can&#8217;t  fight blood. That&#8217;s why your mama had to let your daddy fly. And that&#8217;s why she had to pretend she didn&#8217;t love every minute of it when she was up in that damn plane with him.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You see, we all have our nature at the core of everything we do. There&#8217;s no changing it, no matter how we try. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a farming man. Have been, ever since Lincoln gave my granddaddy an acre and no mule to work it with. And why your mother is the head of the household, man or no man around the house. And why you have to fly, no matter what it takes.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I blink, astonished. Sudden tears fill my eyes. &#8220;But it&#8217;s dangerous, Grandy.&#8221; I think of Patsy&#8217;s tiny funeral, with only me, Lily, and Emily Harper present. At least we knew about Patsy&#8217;s landlady. But I can&#8217;t risk telling anyone about my family. Jolene was right. If something happens, who will tell them about me?</div><div class="tx">&#8220;A tractor killed your daddy, Ida Mae, but we still use tractors. An airplane is no different. It&#8217;s just a tool, if you know how to use it right.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s the same argument I gave Mama, but I shake my head. &#8220;Everything I&#8217;m doing is based on a lie. I&#8217;ve turned my back on where I come from, Grandy, on being who we are.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We&#8217;ve reached the tractor, resting in the field like an ailing cow. Grandy reaches under the shiny red hood and yanks out a rubber tube. &#8220;Baby girl, haven&#8217;t you heard a thing I&#8217;ve said? You are who you are, Ida Mae. Black or white, red or brown, you can&#8217;t change it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He hands me the hose and the engine part. I stand by dutifully while he dives in with both hands.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;If . . .&#8221; He grunts, pulling at another hose. &#8220;If some white  folks want to buy what you&#8217;re selling, let &#8217;em. In the end, the goods are delivered. Right?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Right.&#8221; The tears are coming now, but I&#8217;m smiling, too.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;They get their planes, don&#8217;t they? You ain&#8217;t selling them to the secret Negro army, are you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, Grandy. I&#8217;m not.&#8221; He&#8217;s trying to make me laugh. It&#8217;s almost working.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, then. Give me that hose back.&#8221; I hand it to him. &#8220;This damn tractor&#8217;s useless.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Then why do you keep giving it a new paint job every year?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Grandy frowns at me. &#8220;Don&#8217;t sass me, girl. Besides, a man&#8217;s got to have something to do with his hands.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">For the first time, I look at Grandy&#8217;s tractor engine. &#8220;You know, at the base, we learned to fix our own airplanes. I bet I could take a look at this for you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Grandy finishes reassembling the last piece. He turns to me with a disapproving glare and slowly wipes the grease from his hands onto his faded red rag.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida Mae Jones, you truly haven&#8217;t heard a thing I&#8217;ve said. I told you, a man&#8217;s got to have something to do with his hands. This tractor is mine. You go find something else to occupy your time.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I stand there in front of my grandfather and think he&#8217;s the next-best thing to having Daddy here. Grandy keeps that stern face up, even though he&#8217;s got me smiling from ear to ear. I throw my arms around his neck and pull his head down so I can kiss his bald spot.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I think I know where I can find a few airplanes,&#8221; I tell him.</div><div class="tx">Now Grandy smiles, pink gums and white teeth. He laughs, a low chuckle that sounds like he&#8217;s heard a dirty joke. &#8220;Now, that&#8217;s my girl. Finally got her ears open. Tell your mama you&#8217;ve got a job to do. She&#8217;ll come around. Even if she says she won&#8217;t. That&#8217;s the way it was with your daddy.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thanks, Grandy.&#8221; I hug him again. This hug is going to have to last me a long time. Because tomorrow morning, I head to California to start my first day on the job as a full-fledged WASP.</div></body></html>';

Charlie Washington is young, probably my age. But I don&#8217;t feel like a kid anymore. Something about the training, maybe, or all of the hours in the air, but in the past two years, it feels like I&#8217;ve gotten twice as old as I was when I showed up in Sweetwater. It&#8217;s the first time Lily and I have been back to California since Patsy died. I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s not the same base. I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;d handle that.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I thought Roosevelt was president,&#8221; one of the girls says. Lily and I laugh. There are four of us new WASP assigned to March. The other two are from another class, half a year our senior. They&#8217;ve been reassigned from Delaware.</div><div class="tx">Charlie Washington&#8217;s happy grin falters. &#8220;Uh . . . I&#8217;m supposed to show you to your barracks. They&#8217;re new, just finished last month. Before that, all the girls on base had to stay in town.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We nod. It&#8217;s a familiar story. Two years into the program and still half the army isn&#8217;t prepared to house women. It&#8217;s all part of what the WASP are lobbying for in Washington.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Anything&#8217;s better than the bunks we had in Delaware,&#8221; the taller of the two girls tells us. Her name is Lucille. She&#8217;s a big-shouldered gal from Tennessee, with hair the same color as a cup of black coffee, no cream. &#8220;That little state&#8217;s as cold  as a brass bra in winter.&#8221; Her partner, Delilah, is from Massachusetts. I guess the cold weather didn&#8217;t bother her half as much.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;ll all be changing soon everywhere,&#8221; Lily says. &#8220;Once we get full military status, the WASP will have real barracks like the rest of the army. Heated, too.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;A girl can dream,&#8221; I say. Sure, Jackie Cochran and Nancy Love have both been fighting for the WASP in D.C., trying to get us full soldier&#8217;s rights, but it doesn&#8217;t look like Washington is going for it. For one thing, if they make us military, then we get to stay, even when the war ends. It&#8217;s a nice thought for some, but a lot of WASP have a life not easily left behind. Some of the women have kids. Or mothers like mine, who want their daughters to have a normal life. And friends like Jolene, who just don&#8217;t understand. It&#8217;s a real mixed bag. And then there are all those men who&#8217;ll want their jobs back when they get home from the war.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, never say never,&#8221; Lily replies.</div><div class="tx">I shrug. &#8220;If anyone can make it happen, Jackie Cochran can.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Charlie Washington leads us to a low cinder-block building at the edge of a cluster of other cinder-block squares. &#8220;Home sweet home, ladies,&#8221; he says, with another teenaged grin.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you, Lieutenant,&#8221; I say, and we salute him before checking out our new home.</div><div class="tx">March is the third base Lily and I have been stationed at since going on active duty a month and a half ago. It&#8217;s much the same as the others, except here the WASP have their own barracks. At our first assignment, in Arizona, we had to bunk on the floor of the base nurses&#8217; rooms. Sleeping bags are a  hard way to live for weeks at a time. Especially after having just slept in your own bed at home. The run-down boardinghouse outside our second base was no picnic, either. We were both more than glad to pull down target-towing duty out here in California.</div><div class="tx">The officer in charge shows up at our barracks after lunch and tells us his boys are on night practice. We&#8217;ll be taking off as soon as it&#8217;s full dark, at about twenty hundred hours.</div><div class="tx">I drop down onto my cot. It&#8217;s the second to last one, at the far end of the room, just like my old bunk at Avenger Field. It&#8217;s my own little superstition, and I&#8217;m sticking with it. Lily has taken up the bunk next to mine against the wall, where Patsy used to sleep. I&#8217;m glad of it, and I try not to think of it as a bad omen. I may have lost Patsy and Jolene, but Lily&#8217;s become the sister I never had. I&#8217;d die before I lost her, too.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Did I tell you I got another letter from Harry?&#8221; Lily asks me. Her eyes are as bright as her voice. I smile. Only a handful of letters have come for me since Jolene and I had our fight. I keep writing to Grandy and Thomas, who tells me Mama&#8217;s still mad I didn&#8217;t stay, but she heard what I had to say before I left, about having a job to do. She understands what that means, and she&#8217;s willing to forgive. When it comes to Jolene, though, I don&#8217;t know what to say. Lily&#8217;s better at long-distance relationships than I am.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What&#8217;s lover boy up to now?&#8221; I ask her.</div><div class="tx">Lily rummages through her duffel bag and pulls out an envelope. Draped across her bed on her stomach, red curls shining in the afternoon light coming through the window, she looks for all the world like a love-struck teenager mooning over some movie star in a magazine.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Here, he says he&#8217;s been keeping up on all the latest field medicine and the latest swing dances at the officers&#8217; club. Oh, but he promises he never asks the girls their first names. Keeps it very polite.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily frowns at me. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t seem right, does it? I ask people&#8217;s first names. I&#8217;ll have to write him and tell him to do it, too.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; I say. &#8220;Call them miss, or missus, or Mary Jane. Just don&#8217;t call them sweetheart.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily throws a sock at me. &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;d never do that. I don&#8217;t know why you make me worry so, Ida. What we need to do is find you a fellow, too, and then you&#8217;ll have plenty to keep you occupied when we aren&#8217;t in the air.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I roll over onto my stomach and try not to think of Walt Jenkins. &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t need a man to keep me occupied. I just wish we could get into another plane. Being a WASP sounded more glamorous before I became one.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the way everything is,&#8221; Lily says. &#8220;I mean, look at me. I&#8217;m giddy as a schoolgirl about marrying Harry, but when was the last time you saw an old married lady get giddy over anything?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I sigh. &#8220;Nothing lasts, I guess.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Nope,&#8221; Lily says happily. &#8220;Not a thing.&#8221; She flips onto her back and smiles up at Harry&#8217;s letter. &#8220;Including this horrid war. When it&#8217;s over, you&#8217;re going to be my maid of honor.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I smile. &#8220;Sounds great.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It will be.&#8221; She hugs the letter to her chest, and we while away the rest of the afternoon until the sun goes down and it&#8217;s time to go to work.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">The Curtiss A-25, or Shrike, is a single-prop attack plane with a dark body, white belly, and stars set in a circle of blue on either wing. The Shrike&#8217;s a dive-bomber, with room for a pilot, a gunner, and a couple thousand pounds of bombs. Not that we get to do dives on towing duty. Target towing sounds simple, and it is. We go up, two of us together, Lily and me in one plane, Lucille and Delilah in the other, pulling giant target flags attached to the tails of our A-25s. That&#8217;s all the skill there is to it. Then we circle over the gunnery range in long slow lines. Down on the ground is where all the action is. Tonight the boys will be using 90-mm antiaircraft guns, big, long-nosed guns that can shoot twenty or more rounds a minute. Two soldiers man a searchlight, scanning the sky for the target, and the rest of the crew cranks that gun around as fast as they can, aiming to shoot a bull&#8217;s-eye on our flag.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;La de dee, la dee da,&#8221; Lily hums as we take off. All systems are go and everything is smooth as silk. It&#8217;s a beautiful night for flying, too. All of that Link training has paid off. I feel just as peachy flying under the starry sky now as I do under the noontime sun.</div><div class="tx">We do our first pass, and the deep thocking sound of the guns echoes from below. Lily looks out the window as I circle around. If you do it right, the target takes its time catching up to you, and you can see if it&#8217;s been hit or not.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;One hit, not exactly a bull&#8217;s-eye,&#8221; Lily says with a chuckle. &#8220;They took the tail corner off.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Not good enough.&#8221; I grin. We swing around for our second pass. It&#8217;s too loud inside the plane for us to hear the silk flag rippling in our wake, but I imagine I can hear it. It sounds  just like the snapping silk scarf Bessie Coleman used to wear when she flew. I like the sound of that.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Holy Moses!&#8221; Lily shrieks. I see it, too. The cauliflower burst of a shell <i>in front</i> of the plane. Not behind us, where it&#8217;s supposed to be.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What the heck are they doing down there?&#8221; I ask. Lily is on the radio in nothing flat. &#8220;Target One to Gunner One, Target One to Gunner One. Adjust your aim. You&#8217;re targeting our plane.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I&#8217;m proud to say it, but Lily is calm as can be on the radio. You never want to sound hysterical, talking to the men on the ground. They get a kick out of scaring little girls, as they put it.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Gunner One to Target One, we copy.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Good,&#8221; Lily says, exasperated. She hangs up the radio mouthpiece and scans the sky. I keep us steady and right on course.</div><div class="tx">When the bullets hit us, they come right through the left wing.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Jesus, Lily, they&#8217;re shooting us!&#8221; I adjust the wings and speed up the plane. The faster we get out of range, the better. If we get killed by friendly fire, Mama would never forgive me or Uncle Sam.</div><div class="tx">Lily grabs the radio again. &#8220;Mayday, Gunner One, mayday. We&#8217;ve been hit.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Not possible, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; the voice on the other end of the radio says.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Damn right it&#8217;s possible. You stop shooting right now. We&#8217;re coming down!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I&#8217;ve already got my headset open to the control tower. &#8220;Target One to tower. Emergency landing. We&#8217;ve been hit by Gunner One.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You&#8217;ve been what?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hit by Gunner One. They&#8217;re all over the place down there.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Are you safe to land?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I scan the instruments in front of me. Oil pressure is fine; I&#8217;m holding altitude. &#8220;Roger that. Mostly cosmetic damage, I think. But don&#8217;t hold me to that, and don&#8217;t leave us up here long enough for it to change.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Copy.&#8221; The traffic controller clears a path for us to land. The base fire truck and a medical jeep are at the far end of the tarmac when we come in.</div><div class="tx">The second we roll to a stop, Lily jumps to her feet. &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna kill someone,&#8221; she says. Her cheeks are almost as red as her hair.</div><div class="tx">I unstrap myself from my chair. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to wait in line.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Is that really all we are to them, Ida? Guinea pigs? Disposable targets?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I think of the way Patsy died, the way the engineer tried to rush me through my flight check that day. Testing new planes and guns on WASP, like any other scientific experiment. &#8220;You might be right, Lily. God, I hope you&#8217;re not right.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The line of holes punched through the left wing makes my heart sink. I run a finger lightly over the edges of torn metal. For someone who wasn&#8217;t targeting us, Gunner One sure did a bang-up job. A few inches to the left and we might not even be standing here.</div><div class="tx">This time, we don&#8217;t go through channels. We commandeer  the med jeep and drive out onto the gunnery range. The poor driver barely brings the jeep to a stop before we jump out.</div><div class="tx">I storm up to the first soldier I see who isn&#8217;t still manning one of the guns. His back is to me and his head is in his hand. I grab his arm. &#8220;Who the hell&#8217;s your CO?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">He turns around, startled. It&#8217;s Lieutenant Charlie Washington, our guide from this morning. &#8220;It&#8217;s me, ma&#8217;am. I . . .&#8221; He looks lost. His eyes are big as a cow&#8217;s.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s my . . . my first commission as gunnery command. I . . . these guns are . . . I&#8217;m awful sorry. Are you and the other lady hurt?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You son of a&#8212;&#8221; Lily stops in her tracks when she sees Charlie. I turn in time to see recognition dawn on her face.</div><div class="tx">She pats Charlie on the back. &#8220;You poor kid. You poor, stupid kids.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She points, and I see that Charlie Washington is the oldest of the lot.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Holy moly. Is this what we&#8217;re down to?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily nods. &#8220;Uncle Sam&#8217;ll be issuing diapers next.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sorry, Lieutenant,&#8221; I tell him. &#8220;This is going to be in our report. Do better next time.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he says, taking off his flack helmet.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Helmet on, soldier!&#8221; a man shouts from another jeep that&#8217;s just pulled up. By his uniform, he&#8217;s a captain, and Charlie&#8217;s in a world of trouble.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;This is an active gunnery range. Ladies, I&#8217;ll have to ask you to leave. We&#8217;ll discuss this in the morning.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, sir, Captain, sir!&#8221; Lily and I shout, and salute him.</div><div class="tx">Later that night, Lily and I sit up in our cots playing Old Maid by moonlight.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;How did this happen?&#8221; I ask her.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What happen?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I look at her face. The freckles are still just as fresh on her nose as they were the day we met. &#8220;How did we get to be so old? I mean, you saw those kids out there tonight. They were babies.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily sighs. &#8220;I know what you mean. Do you know what my mother said when she heard about Hitler invading Poland? She said, &#8216;These are the things that make us old.&#8217;&#8221; She shuffles through her cards and then stops, frowning. When she looks up again, her eyes are damp with unshed tears.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ever since Patsy died, I&#8217;ve been thinking, what if this is it? What if this is it for all of us? There&#8217;s another accident, like there could have been tonight, or I don&#8217;t know, what if Hitler wins?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I stretch my arms and sigh. Sometimes I miss Jolene and my family so much that it wears me out inside. At least my family is talking to me, though. Jolene is like a hole in my heart that just won&#8217;t heal. &#8220;This war will make old maids out of all of us.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; Lily says. &#8220;Harry might not want to marry me if I&#8217;m an old maid.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I chuckle and drop my cards, my heart no longer in the game. We sit there on my cot beneath the window, watching the moon float in the sky like a bar of Ivory soap in a bath.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now,&#8221; Lily says. &#8220;If only we could get our hands on a real plane. I feel like a bus driver up there in that Shrike.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I laugh and throw a pillow at her. &#8220;Amen, sister. Amen! They don&#8217;t call it the &#8216;Big-Tailed Beast&#8217; for nothing,&#8221; I say, referring to one of the A-25&#8217;s nicknames. Inwardly, I shrug. Why worry about tomorrow when you can worry about today?</div><div class="tx1">Less than a week later, our prayers are answered. A letter straight from Deatie Deaton herself says Jackie Cochran has reviewed our records, and there&#8217;s something special she wants us to fly. Two days later, Lily and I say goodbye to Lucille and Delilah and take the train back east to Birmingham, Alabama, to see what the first lady of aviation&#8217;s got in mind.</div></body></html>';

We&#8217;re in a briefing room at Birmingham Army Air Base. We arrived last night with no further instructions than to see the commanding officer. Colonel Leland Griffith is a kind-faced man with graying temples and a gruff voice. He made sure we had a hot breakfast at the officers&#8217; mess before our meeting. It&#8217;s 7 A.M. Lily and I are in our dress blues. I clear my throat.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, sir. It&#8217;s experimental, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Colonel Griffith looks uneasy, but he nods. &#8220;Do you know what the flyboys call it?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;The Superfortress, sir.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s the right answer. Colonel Griffith relaxes back into his chair. I feel a flash of pride. I&#8217;ve done my homework well.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Did you ever wonder why the army&#8217;d design a plane big enough to fit a platoon of elephants?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily answers first. &#8220;No, sir. But the army must have its reasons.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Griffith actually smiles this time. &#8220;Good answer, Miss Lowenstein.&#8221; He pauses, takes a glance at a file on his desk, and frowns.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ever see one?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; we reply.</div><div class="tx">There is an honest-to-God twinkle in the colonel&#8217;s eye when he asks, &#8220;Would you like to?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sir, yes, sir!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I break into a face-splitting grin before I can stop myself. I look at Lily, and she&#8217;s grinning, too, so I guess it&#8217;s okay.</div><div class="tx">With another nod, Colonel Griffith rises from behind his desk and leads us out to a hangar at the back of the airfield. In those few moments, with the crisp blue Alabama sky above us and the comfortable sound of transport planes overhead, I feel as if I could float away on a cloud. Or worse, wake up and miss all the excitement.</div><div class="tx">The B-29 is the largest plane I&#8217;ve ever seen. It&#8217;s a mastodon compared to the little ATs and P-50s we&#8217;ve been flying. Daddy&#8217;s little Jenny would fit in the belly of this plane three times over. This is the real deal. Flying her will take skill, strength, and a little bit of luck. My fingers tingle just thinking about it.</div><div class="tx">Lily claps once in delight.</div><div class="tx">I can&#8217;t help but ask. &#8220;What kind of bombs are they carrying in this thing?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">At last, the wrong question. Griffith frowns at me. &#8220;None, as of yet. Damn thing&#8217;s harder than a mule train to fly.&#8221; He stops in the shadow of the starboard wing and turns to face us.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Let&#8217;s get down to brass tacks, ladies. I&#8217;ve been reading your records. So have a few other folks up top. You&#8217;ve got three days to learn how to fly this thing.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily and I blink at him. &#8220;And then what?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The colonel glances up at the wing soaring over his head. He looks small compared to the big bird. And if he looks small, I know I look like next to nothing.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And then,&#8221; he says, &#8220;we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</div><div class="tx1">For one whole day, Lily and I sit in a private office in the officers&#8217; compound, poring over the specs of the plane. Nobody  bothers us. Just a few flyboys who haven&#8217;t seen girls in a while &#8220;accidentally&#8221; knocking on the wrong door. The way we figure it, the B-29 must be experimental. It wouldn&#8217;t be the first time a WASP had flown something new or difficult. Planes like the PT-19 were considered too powerful until a WASP showed she could handle it. Lily and I are determined not to let the WASP down. We study every inch of that plane, and when our eyes get crossed and start seeing double, we have dinner with the colonel in his private dining room and get a ride back to the boardinghouse off base where women visitors have to sleep.</div><div class="tx">On the second day, Lily and I head back to the hangar to visit the B-29 in the flesh, so to say. With a work light in one hand and the manual in another, we explore every detail. It&#8217;s a big plane, like I&#8217;ve said. It takes all day. But by the end of it, we&#8217;re both pretty sure of ourselves, sitting in that giant cockpit. Colonel Griffith joins us to explain the next day&#8217;s procedures.</div><div class="tx">Normally, there&#8217;d be a crew of eleven that goes up in these birds&#8212;pilot, co-pilot, three gunners, and a crew to handle targeting and dropping the bombs. Since tomorrow is just a lap around the airfield, Colonel Griffith wants us to take three of his men up with us.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;So you get the real feel of her,&#8221; he says. We both know it&#8217;s so the men can take over if the girls choke.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">&#8220;This is fine,&#8221; Lily says from her piloting chair. We&#8217;ve both strapped in and are getting comfortable with the reach of the controls.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, yes, it is,&#8221; I agree. This is a big plane, and she&#8217;s going to be heavy as a sack of wet sand to pull off the runway, but  it&#8217;s a treat just sitting here. No sirree, these two girls won&#8217;t fail.</div><div class="tx">So far, our stay at Birmingham has been pretty quiet. There&#8217;s all sorts of activity on the base when we drive on in the morning and when we leave at night. But nothing that involves us. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a surprise on the morning of the third day when there&#8217;s a crowd out to greet us on the tarmac. It looks like just about every doughboy this side of the Mississippi has shown up. Colonel Griffith rides out to the hangar with us in a jeep. He&#8217;s in full dress uniform, so you&#8217;d think he had planned the whole thing, but he sure looks upset at the sight of all those soldier boys.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Aw, hell. Who called them here?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sir?&#8221; Lily and I are in our zoot suits and pigtails&#8212;one of the privileges of being full-fledged WASP, no more turbans for us. I&#8217;ve got butterflies the size of eagles this morning, and facing the masses when I&#8217;m in my flying jammies doesn&#8217;t help.</div><div class="tx">Griffith drops down in his seat. &#8220;Keep going.&#8221; The driver takes us past the crowd of soldiers and into the hangar with the B-29. He drives fast, but not fast enough for Lily and I to miss one of the men shouting, &#8220;Another Widowmaker.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Excuse me, sir, but what&#8217;s going on?&#8221; Lily asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Begging your pardon,&#8221; I add. &#8220;But what did he mean by &#8216;Widowmaker&#8217;?&#8221; Every WASP knew about the first &#8220;Widowmaker&#8221;&#8212;the B-26 Marauder, a plane that tended to crash on takeoff. I look the colonel in the eye and wait for an answer.</div><div class="tx">Colonel Griffith actually blushes. He takes off his hat and steps out of the jeep. A full thirty seconds pass before he turns to us.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ladies, you have twenty minutes to get in that plane and get it down that runway. We&#8217;ve got a crowd out there, and we might as well use it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily and I exchange glances. I don&#8217;t like not knowing what&#8217;s going on, but this is the army. We don&#8217;t have to like it. We just have to do what we&#8217;re told.</div><div class="tx">Lily frowns at me, then shrugs. We both take a deep breath and start our flight check. While we&#8217;re going over the wings, the rest of our flight crew shows up. Colonel Griffith, who has been pacing by the jeep like a daddy-to-be in a hospital waiting room, introduces them to us.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ladies, this here is Captain Hank Rhodes, Lieutenant Davis Warner, and Lieutenant Daniel Sparks.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We shake hands down the line. Captain Hank is a square-jawed, dark-haired man, about Thomas&#8217;s age. Davis Warner and Daniel Sparks could be twins, except Warner has brown hair and Sparks is a redhead. They both have freckles, blue eyes, and wide grins. They can&#8217;t be much more than eighteen or nineteen. But then again, I&#8217;m only twenty-one.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We&#8217;re the bombardiers,&#8221; Sparks says once the colonel has returned to his pacing. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be flying navigation and radio today in case . . . well. You can call me Sparky.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I know what the &#8220;in case&#8221; is. The bombardier&#8217;s seat is in the nose of the plane. If we can&#8217;t fly this thing, it&#8217;s the worst spot to be in for an emergency landing. I guess I can&#8217;t hold that against him.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thanks, Sparky. You can call me Jonesy,&#8221; I say.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m just Lily, but that&#8217;ll do, too.&#8221; Lily shakes Sparky&#8217;s hand.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sparks, let the ladies finish their flight check. Everything&#8217;s  got to go perfect if we&#8217;re gonna pull this off,&#8221; Hank says. His voice is surprisingly high for someone with such a square jaw. He looks like Clark Gable without the mustache, but he sounds like Mickey Rooney.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you, Captain,&#8221; I say, and Lily and I double-check the wing before moving on to the fuel line.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ready, Eddy,&#8221; Lily finally says, checking off the last of our list.</div><div class="tx">I nod and open the door to the plane. Lily wheels up a stepladder. &#8220;Gentlemen first,&#8221; we say. Sparks seems to like that. He chuckles, shakes his head, and climbs aboard.</div><div class="tx">The men settle into their stations in the compartment behind the pilot and co-pilot seats and we head out of the hangar and onto the runway with little fanfare. I&#8217;m surprised the colonel didn&#8217;t have us leave under cover of darkness, he seems so displeased by the crowd outside. Then again, maybe this is what he really wants.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I just had an idea, Lily.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Fly us all to Acapulco for supper?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No. I mean, it seems to me the colonel is using us as an example. You and I both know that the army can keep a secret when it wants to.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s for sure,&#8221; Lily agrees.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, then, why do you suppose there just happen to be sixty soldiers with nothing better to do than watch us this morning?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily frowns, then smiles. &#8220;Because they want to see what a girl can do.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I nod. &#8220;With the &#8216;Widowmaker.&#8217;&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily grins. &#8220;Oh, boy. This should be a hoot.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What are you ladies talking about up there?&#8221; Captain Hank has stuck his head into the cockpit. Lily and I put on our best innocent faces.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Just the weather, sir. Now, go buckle in; we&#8217;re about to take off.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We taxi into position and run an engine check, firing each engine separately from left to right. At full throttle, a B-29 engine will rattle your teeth. Lily and I grin at each other. This plane beats a Jenny any day. The engines work just fine, so I power all four of them up to a deafening roar. The plane jostles and shakes like a wild horse trying to throw a rider.</div><div class="tx">The green flag waves and I release the brakes to start off our long takeoff roll. B-29s take twice as much runway as smaller planes to get off the ground. We roll forward, gaining speed as the runway rushes beneath us.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ready, Lily?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ready, steady,&#8221; she says with a nod. I flex my arms, preparing for liftoff.</div><div class="tx">The end of the runway looms before us. I grab the stick and pull. My muscles go tight, but the nose of this thing is barely budging. I grit my teeth. It&#8217;s harder to lift than even I thought it would be.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida?&#8221; Lily sounds worried. She&#8217;s got her hands full with levers for the landing gear, but she sees me struggling.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Got it, got it,&#8221; I say. But I don&#8217;t. Not yet, anyway.</div><div class="tx">And then, I do. The nose of the plane lifts so quickly, you&#8217;d think it was apologizing for reacting so late. We bob up into the air, a little wobbly, but in the air all the same. From there, we climb steadily and the engines smooth out from a bone-shaking roar to a sweet, steady hum. Turns out  the B-29 is like a seagull, awkward and ungainly on land, but boy, it sure can fly.</div><div class="tx">Lily gives a little cheer. I hear it echoed from the navigation station by Sparky. When we reach our cruising altitude, I loosen up my arms. My biceps are sore, but in a good way. I guess all those years of picking up Otis Wilson&#8217;s laundry finally paid off.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Would you look at that?&#8221; Lily points out the window. The entire airfield is looking up at us.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I bet their mouths are hanging wide open.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I certainly hope so.&#8221; We veer off on a wide loop of the air base. That&#8217;s all Colonel Griffith wanted. A victory lap, so to speak. We circle the airfield two times for good measure. If only my daddy could see me. They used to say that colored folk couldn&#8217;t fly, but look at us now.</div><div class="tx">Lily is in her own private world of smiles, too. It&#8217;s a good feeling. All the hard work and training it took to get into the WASP is paying off in a lump sum.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Smooth flying, ladies,&#8221; Sparky says from the back. Without even turning around, I can hear he&#8217;s all grins. I am, too.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Thank you, Lieutenant Sparks,&#8221; Lily says for me. I&#8217;m too busy lining up for the final approach. I take a deep breath.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And now, for the tricky part.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Landing gear, ready,&#8221; Lily says. We&#8217;ve studied it every which way, and in the end it&#8217;s the same. The B-29 has trouble landing. She tends to stall out and just drop. Some planes are too big to glide to a stop comfortably. That&#8217;s why the army doesn&#8217;t have more of them around. That&#8217;s probably why they&#8217;re calling it the &#8220;Widowmaker&#8221; on the ground. And that&#8217;s exactly why we&#8217;re here to fly it.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Here we go,&#8221; I say.</div><div class="tx">Suddenly, the plane lurches like an old drunk. The steady drone of the engines stops. When it starts again, it&#8217;s too quiet.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We&#8217;ve lost an engine,&#8221; I say, trying not to panic. The plane wobbles. I grip the stick with both hands to correct it.</div><div class="tx">Lily says nothing, but the knuckles gripping the sides of her seat are white.</div><div class="tx">From the compartment behind us, somebody shouts. Someone else swears.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Status, boys?&#8221; I call out. My voice is getting too high. I belatedly pull up from the final approach. We can&#8217;t land. Not just yet.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Davis is hurt. Got his hand smashed climbing through to the gunnery. What happened?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I shake my head. &#8220;What the B-29&#8217;s probably famous for. One of the engines stalled. We&#8217;re running on three now.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Number four&#8217;s on fire,&#8221; Lily adds. My eyes go wide, and I spare a quick look. Oily black smoke streams away from the right wing. I can&#8217;t see any flames, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t there.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s just peachy,&#8221; I mutter, and try to figure out what to do.</div><div class="tx">There&#8217;s a shuffle, and Captain Hank appears between Lily and me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s time I take over,&#8221; he says. His eyes are on the airfield. The B-29 shudders around us. Limping in. It&#8217;s only a matter of time before we lose another engine. Or the fire spreads.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No.&#8221; I stay in my seat. &#8220;No, sir. We&#8217;ve trained on stalled planes before. I know how to handle it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">For the first time, the look Captain Hank gives me isn&#8217;t friendly. &#8220;Well, you may have noticed that the B-29 isn&#8217;t just any old plane. I&#8217;m surprised your arms didn&#8217;t give out just getting us into the air. I&#8217;ll be hanged if I&#8217;m going to get caught in a crack-up just because some dame wants to prove a point.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s not our point, sir, it&#8217;s Colonel Griffith&#8217;s.&#8221; Lily&#8217;s finally found her voice. I&#8217;m glad because whether I like it or not, this plane is heavy and keeping her steady is like wrestling an angry gator. Any energy spent trying to convince the captain makes flying even harder.</div><div class="tx">Lily&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s enough to make Captain Hank hesitate. Before he can think of anything else to say, Lily picks up the radio and asks the tower for Colonel Griffith. I make a full circuit of the airstrip while they connect us to the radio in his jeep. With any luck, the engine fire will burn itself out. Or we&#8217;ll land first.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Captain Hank,&#8221; I say, trying not to grit my teeth. &#8220;Please strap yourself in. We don&#8217;t want any more injuries, do we?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Captain Hank looks at me, then at Lily. He shakes his head, crosses himself, and returns to his seat.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What should I tell the colonel?&#8221; Lily asks.</div><div class="tx">I shrug as much as my grip on the stick will allow. &#8220;Tell him the truth.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily looks at me, and her brown eyes are wide with worry. &#8220;What is the truth, Ida? I&#8217;ve seen you land a pursuit plane in a stall before, but this? We&#8217;re burning.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">For an instant, we both see it, Patsy&#8217;s Valiant blooming into flames, like some terrible flower.</div><div class="tx">I take my eyes off the view in front of me just long enough to read the look in Lily&#8217;s eyes.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be stubborn, Jonesy,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Be safe.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Right.&#8221; I don&#8217;t say anything for what feels like forever. It&#8217;s funny how danger can make time stand dead still. I think about the plane I&#8217;m holding up by sheer force of will and the four souls on board with me. For some reason, I think about Thomas, running up that country road, trying to get to a doctor before Death could get to Daddy. I think of Mama trying to keep me at home. Of Jolene trying not to tap her toes to the radio when Mrs. Wilson was in the house. Of Patsy never letting old Unhappy Martin tell her how to fly.</div><div class="tx">I take a deep breath and look at Lily. She&#8217;s my last friend on earth right now. I&#8217;d never do a thing to hurt her.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I can do this,&#8221; I tell her. And as I say it, I know that it&#8217;s true. &#8220;We can do this.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily looks at me a moment longer. The radio crackles.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Griffith here.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily hesitates. She takes a deep breath.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Colonel Griffith, this is Lily Lowenstein. We have a slight problem up here. Engine three&#8217;s stalled out and number four&#8217;s on fire. It&#8217;s procedure to have emergency services waiting on the ground. If you want them. This is your show, Colonel. We&#8217;ll do our job. We&#8217;re coming in on the next circuit. Lowenstein out.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The radio lies silent.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;d be nice to have those fire trucks out there,&#8221; I admit. &#8220;Just for comfort&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily blanches. &#8220;You said you could do this, Ida.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I nod. &#8220;I can, I can. Still . . .&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I shake my head. &#8220;Aw, hell. Say a prayer, rabbi. We&#8217;re coming in.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I don&#8217;t know if Griffith has gotten the fire trucks out on the tarmac. I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s trusting we can land. My eyes are  on the horizon as it lines up with the white lines down the runway. The plane is shuddering now as we drop lower. The men are silent in the bombing bay, probably straining their ears to catch what happens next.</div><div class="tx">What happens next is like nothing I&#8217;ve ever done in training. We drop from the sky and another engine fails.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That was number one. But you&#8217;re clear. No smoke,&#8221; Lily says. One engine fire we can handle. I throw in the towel at two.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Lily, I need your help,&#8221; I say through clenched teeth. It&#8217;s just too much. The plane is nose heavy and unwieldy. Lily undoes her straps, wraps one around her shoulder, and leans over the chair to help me. We groan with the straining of the wings. We pull for all we are worth. Silently, I swear, I scream, I pray.</div><div class="tx">And then we are level, and then we are landing. Too fast, too damned heavy and fast. All the weight in the nose of the plane smacks the ground with force. The tail of the plane almost spins, we&#8217;re so top heavy and off balance.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hold it, hold it!&#8221; I grab Lily by the arm. She slips but keeps her hands on the stick. I stand on the brakes with both legs. Not too fast, not too fast, or we could roll.</div><div class="tx">The muscles in my legs burn. My fingers ache from holding the stick.</div><div class="tx">And then, we stop. We are on the ground, safe and sound.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Look,&#8221; I say to Lily. At the end of the tarmac, a single fire truck, lights off, trundles toward us, out of sight of our audience by the hangars.</div><div class="tx">Lily starts to laugh. I join her. We laugh until there are tears streaming from our eyes, down our cheeks. Captain Hank and his boys are on us in a second.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;They&#8217;re hysterical, sir,&#8221; Sparky says. That makes us laugh even harder. Captain Hank, who&#8217;s had more experience with the hazards of flying and with the hazards of women, merely shakes his head and follows us out of the plane.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Dames are crazy, Sparky. Don&#8217;t you ever forget it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; Sparky says seriously. &#8220;I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</div></body></html>';

Then we undo our pigtails. She fluffs out her hair and I smooth down my frizzy braids. We put on our reddest Cochran Cosmetics lipstick and walk down the steps just as cool as cucumbers. Captain Hank and Sparky follow, with poor Davis and his banged-up hand in between them. I notice he keeps his hand out of sight of the crowd.</div><div class="tx">Colonel Griffith is waiting for us. He shakes our hands with a grin almost as big as the B-29&#8217;s wingspan and helps us into his jeep. Without a word to any of the men standing around, we head back to the colonel&#8217;s office.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;They&#8217;ll be talking about this for weeks,&#8221; Griffith says. He&#8217;s pleased as punch, I can tell. &#8220;The day two girls tamed the B-29. Corporal, get Dulles on the horn for me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The jeep driver grabs the radio, squawks into it, then passes it to the colonel.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Dulles, Griffith here. They did it. Damned if they didn&#8217;t, with a bum engine, too. No. I&#8217;ll give Cochran a call when we get to my office. But spread the word. We&#8217;ll have no trouble finding pilots now.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily and I exchange glances. I shake my head. How can I be so proud at succeeding and feel so insulted at the same time?</div><div class="tx">&#8220;WASP aren&#8217;t going to be delivering these bombers, are they, sir?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Griffith looks at me. &#8220;Of course not, Miss Jones. This was  strictly to prove a point. You girls are a lot braver than most of the men we&#8217;ve got out there. They hear &#8216;Widowmaker&#8217; and run the other way. But I got word the WASP had something to prove. And you did it, by gum, you didn&#8217;t back down, even when the engines crapped out. Why, I&#8217;d buy you a drink if I didn&#8217;t think you look too young. But the B-29 is back in business. Now maybe we can get this war over with.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily and I take the next jeep available back to our boardinghouse.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;How do you like that,&#8221; Lily fumes. &#8220;Good enough to risk our necks for his stupid demonstration but not good enough to fly full-time.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I drop down to my bed and strip off my boots. &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing new, Lily. They&#8217;ve been using the WASP to do dirty work since the program started. Testing planes that aren&#8217;t fit to fly. &#8216;If a girl can do it, so can a man.&#8217; That should be the army&#8217;s new motto.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily paces the floor, hands on her hips.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I wish there was something we could do. I don&#8217;t know, write a letter to the president. Better yet, his wife. Anything. We can do so much more than they&#8217;ll ever let us do.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I don&#8217;t say anything for a long time. Lily&#8217;s just finding out what I&#8217;ve been living with my whole life. She&#8217;s never known what it was like to be hobbled by somebody else&#8217;s rules. Suddenly, I&#8217;ve got a sorrow so deep inside of me, it hurts to breathe.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sacrifice,&#8221; I say finally.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What?&#8221; Lily stops in her tracks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I said, sacrifice. My grandfather told me that war is about sacrifice. We don&#8217;t get any medals for the things we do. We don&#8217;t get a parade when we go home. That&#8217;s for the boys. And  I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll deserve it. My brother deserves it and then some. But what my granddad didn&#8217;t know is that women sacrifice all the time.&#8221; I look up at Lily.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You know what I mean. My mama&#8217;s back home right now saving up bacon fat and counting ration stamps so her family can live another day. My girlfriend Jolene works her fingers to the bone cleaning houses so one day she can wear a proper dress at her wedding.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;My mama gave up her son to fight the war. And let her only daughter go, too. And your mother, too, Lily. That&#8217;s a sacrifice that gets no reward. So why should we be any different? We&#8217;re WASP, not military, not soldiers. They won&#8217;t let us be. But you heard Griffith the same as I did. He thinks the B-29&#8217;s gonna end this war. And that&#8217;s all the reward either one of us will ever get. It&#8217;s all the reward we need.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily sinks down on the bed beside me. Our khaki zoot suits look coarse against the fine crocheted bedspread. Our hands are rough, grease under the nails; our hair is still pinched and mussed from our flight helmets. We are not the girls we were a year ago. It&#8217;s no wonder Jolene and I have nothing left in common. I&#8217;m a different person now, inside and out.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Harry will come home,&#8221; Lily says quietly. She laughs. &#8220;And we can get married. Oh, Ida, it all seems so unreal, so far away.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It might be.&#8221; I take her greasy hand in my own, the hand of my new best friend. &#8220;But when it gets here, you&#8217;ll have earned every second of happiness you get.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Both of us.&#8221; Lily grins then, and the world is okay again.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Wash up,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We&#8217;re going out for a steak dinner. Sky&#8217;s the limit!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We do what we can to look like pretty girls for the night.  Lily puts her hair in a bun, and I tie mine back with a ribbon. Our best dresses have survived being rolled up tight in a duffel bag for so long. Within the hour, we&#8217;re presentable enough. Lily tosses her hair.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Patsy would be proud,&#8221; I say.</div><div class="tx">Lily grins. &#8220;Come on, war hero. Let&#8217;s eat.&#8221;</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Our marching orders are waiting for us when we get back to the hotel. I kick off my shoes and lie back on my bed to open the envelope that was waiting for me down in the lobby.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hmm, I&#8217;m supposed to go to Delaware. They&#8217;ve got a shipment of Helldivers to fly out here.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Mmm,&#8221; Lily mumbles, but she isn&#8217;t listening. She had two envelopes waiting for her on the lobby table. The thick white envelope with her orders lies untouched on the other bed. She sits with her back to me, reading the second letter.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What is it?&#8221; I sit up to get a better look, but no luck.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s a telegram,&#8221; she says at last. She looks at me, and her eyes are bright. &#8220;From Harry! He&#8217;s back in the States, Ida, but only for a short time. Stationed in Pennsylvania. That&#8217;s on the way to Delaware, right?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sure, if you want to cut north early, I suppose.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, good!&#8221; She jumps up and runs a little circle between the beds, like she literally doesn&#8217;t know which way to turn. Finally, she just runs to me and gives me a hug.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida, we&#8217;re getting married!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I pat her on the back. &#8220;I know, honey, you&#8217;ve talked about it since the day we met.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily pulls back, shaking her head. &#8220;No, no. I mean now! In Pennsylvania. It&#8217;s all arranged with the base chaplain. He&#8217;s even got a copy of the Torah! Now, I know it&#8217;s not the same  as a rabbi or a real wedding at temple, but I&#8217;ll take it, Ida, I will! I&#8217;m going to be Mrs. Harold Cohen. I can&#8217;t wait!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Fortunately, Lily&#8217;s orders have her flying with me to Delaware. We make things difficult for the travel dispatcher, taking the long way up to Pennsylvania to get to Delaware, but it&#8217;s worth it. The roundabout trip puts us in Chicago for a day, long enough to buy a proper veil and an easy-to-fly-with white satin dress.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Is it all right, Ida?&#8221; Lily asks me in the dressing room of Marshall Field&#8217;s.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You look like a million bucks, Lily. Trust me. You&#8217;ll knock Harry&#8217;s eyes right out of their sockets.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I wish I could,&#8221; Lily says. &#8220;Then they&#8217;d have to Section 8 him and he could stay home with me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Right, and blame you for ruining his career as a surgeon.&#8221; I grin.</div><div class="tx">She smiles back at me in the mirror. &#8220;I just wish Mother was here. But she wouldn&#8217;t approve of this. Running off to join the WASP was bad enough, but coming home married? What a scandal! Never mind that she approved of the engagement, threw a big party and everything.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">She turns to me and sighs. &#8220;Mother always used to say, there&#8217;s nothing a good girl can do after midnight that she can&#8217;t do just as well beforehand. Only, instead of midnight, it&#8217;s this war. I suppose we should wait until the war&#8217;s over, but I don&#8217;t want to anymore, Ida. The longer I wait, the more I think the war will never end.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I shrug. &#8220;In that case, you&#8217;d better grab your coat.&#8221;</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">We arrive at the base in Pennsylvania early on a Tuesday morning. Just before breakfast, I get my first look at Harry Cohen.</div><div class="tx">Harry is exactly Lily&#8217;s height, with wavy dark brown hair trimmed neatly above the ears and neck and a way of making his stiff army officer uniform look casual. I like him instantly. He meets us on the tarmac as we come off our transport. Lily flies into his arms faster than a pursuit plane.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, Harry, yes, Harry, yes!&#8221; Lily exclaims, kissing him all over his happy little face. I stand by our duffel bags and try to give the lovebirds a little privacy. It&#8217;s a long time before they take their eyes off of each other long enough to introduce me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida Mae Jones,&#8221; Harry says, pumping my arm like he&#8217;s jumping a car engine. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard a lot about you from Lily&#8217;s letters. What a pleasure!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;The pleasure&#8217;s all mine, Harry. If I can call you Harry.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Better yet, call me brother. Lily says you&#8217;re like a sister to her. So that makes us all family. Or it will in a few minutes. Let me scare up the chaplain and we can get this show on the road!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">The base chapel is nothing more than a clapboard room off the side of the administrative building. I help Lily get dressed in the lavatory. Someone&#8217;s donated a handful of daisies picked from the officers&#8217; club lawn to serve as a bouquet. Twenty minutes after landing, we walk down the aisle.</div><div class="tx">There&#8217;s an altar with a cross on it, but a Star of David has been placed alongside it for the ceremony. One of Harry&#8217;s friends, another doctor named Mike, stands next to me as a second witness. The chaplain is a young fellow going prematurely bald. He mops his brow and stumbles through some of the Hebrew wording.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;This is my first wedding,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;I&#8217;m a base chaplain. I . . . well, it&#8217;s an honor to perform this service today.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">No matter how the chaplain does, it doesn&#8217;t seem to matter. Lily looks like she&#8217;s hearing angels sing, and Harry&#8217;s got the same stars in his eyes. It&#8217;s the look Mama used to give Daddy before he died. A look no one&#8217;s ever given me, but I suppose I&#8217;ll recognize it now if they do, and I&#8217;ll marry them straightaway.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You may kiss the bride.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Harry pulls Lily into a clench that would do Clark Gable proud. We clap when the chaplain introduces them as Mr. and Mrs. Harry Cohen.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What now?&#8221; Lily asks.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now it&#8217;s time for the reception, of course!&#8221; Harry takes us over to the officers&#8217; club for an early lunch. We toast the happy couple and feast on salmon and boiled potatoes.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And now I&#8217;ve booked us the bridal suite at the best hotel in town,&#8221; Harry says when we&#8217;ve finished polishing off the plate of cookies that served as a wedding cake.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Harry, that&#8217;s impossible! We&#8217;ve got a plane to catch in less than an hour,&#8221; Lily says.</div><div class="tx">Harry blushes. &#8220;Actually, I&#8217;ve had a look at your pilot. He seems a little flushed. Mikey here&#8217;s going to give him a thorough examination before he can take off. We might even prescribe a night&#8217;s bed rest.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Is that so, Harold Cohen? You wouldn&#8217;t be abusing your Hippocratic oath, would you?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;My dear lady, I&#8217;ve sworn to do no harm. And what could cause more pain than missing out on my own wedding night?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida, do you mind?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Of course not. A night in a fancy hotel sounds swell. Enjoy it, Lily.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s the other thing,&#8221; Harry says, blushing red again. &#8220;It&#8217;s not so much a hotel as one of the officers&#8217; houses on base.

Not as glamorous as the B-29, but testing the planes can be a challenge, especially when the repairs don&#8217;t take. By the end of the eighth week, we&#8217;ve used our parachutes so much that we&#8217;ve both joined the Caterpillar Club ten times over. And then we get our new marching orders&#8212;report to officers&#8217; training school in Florida.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; Lily asks. She&#8217;s just washed her hair, a once-a-week luxury for someone with curls like hers. It takes more time to comb them out than we usually have in a day. I&#8217;ve been plotting our next mission. The map lies forgotten on the bed.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It means Uncle Sam is finally making honest women out of us.&#8221; I slap the letter against my thigh. &#8220;Hot dog! This is it, Lily, the whole kit and caboodle. Officers&#8217; pay, officers&#8217; honors. Maybe we can even get them to go back and give Patsy a proper commendation.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;And a military burial,&#8221; Lily adds. She squeezes her hair dry in a thick white towel. &#8220;Now Mother will have to take me seriously. I&#8217;m not only a married woman, but I&#8217;ll also be an officer in the United States Army Air Forces.&#8221; Her eyes sparkle at the thought, and I know mine must be sparkling, too.</div><div class="tx">What will Mama say when she finds out? Or Thomas, for that matter? They&#8217;ll be so proud. At least, I hope they will. I&#8217;m not saying that it&#8217;s permanent, but until the end of the war, this is a whole new life for me. One I&#8217;ve earned. I feel a grin take up residence on my face, and it looks like it&#8217;s there to stay.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Harry and I got married almost two months ago.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I roll my eyes and collapse back onto the bed. I cover my face with a pillow. &#8220;I know, Lily, it&#8217;s been one month and twenty-four days. You said so yourself this morning. You&#8217;ll count off every day for a year if someone doesn&#8217;t stop you soon.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily frowns at me. &#8220;That&#8217;s not what I mean. Do you remember how they used to keep track of our monthlies back at Avenger Field?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Boy, do I.&#8221; It was something we all hated, having to tell Doc Monserud when we had our periods. Patsy said it was to make sure none of us was pregnant, but the Doc claimed it was to see if women with cramps could still fly. I&#8217;d never been so embarrassed in my whole life as I was that first month.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Once a month,&#8221; Lily says absently, pinning her hair up off her face.</div><div class="tx">Suddenly, I get a funny feeling. &#8220;Why, Lily? What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily says nothing. Just keeps pinning up her hair into a bun. When she&#8217;s finished, she comes and sits next to me. Her hands fumble in her lap.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida, it&#8217;s been two months and three days since my last period.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We both sit there, staring at each other. My travel clock ticks loudly on the dresser across the room. We both speak at once.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I think I&#8217;m pregnant.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Congratulations!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Lily gasps, her hands flying into the air. &#8220;Congratulations? Ida, you&#8217;re not mad? I thought you&#8217;d be angry with me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Of course not, silly. You&#8217;re married. That&#8217;s what married women do, have babies.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily throws her arms around me and hugs so tight that her terry-cloth robe leaves little damp impressions on my khakis. Tears fill my eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;m so happy for both of you. Harry&#8217;s gonna be thrilled.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;He will be, won&#8217;t he?&#8221; Lily claps. &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t wait to tell him. But it&#8217;s got to be in person.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, is he still stateside? We could swing by on the way to Florida.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily pauses, her shirt pulled over only one arm. &#8220;Ida, I can&#8217;t go to Florida. They&#8217;ll make me take a physical. They&#8217;ll send me home.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I close my eyes for just a second, to let it really sink in. &#8220;I know.&#8221; I realized it before she said it. She looks so happy. Otherwise, I could never let her go. &#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;m flying the rest of this war without you.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Lily smiles at me and touches my cheek. It&#8217;s an odd gesture, coming from her. &#8220;You looked like my mother when you did that,&#8221; I tell her.</div><div class="tx">Lily smiles even wider. &#8220;You know, Ida Mae Jones, you were born to be a WASP. You&#8217;ll do just fine without me.&#8221;</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1"><i>Dear Jolene . . .</i></div><div class="tx">I stop with my pen above the paper. I don&#8217;t know what comes next. All I do know is that I&#8217;ve never felt so alone in all my life since Lily left.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Do you think you&#8217;ll ever go home, too?&#8221; she asked me when I dropped her off at the train station this morning in a borrowed jeep. &#8220;Your family would love to have you back.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yeah, I suppose they would,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;But . . .&#8221; There were so many things I couldn&#8217;t say, so I said nothing. Lily shook her head.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Like I said, born to be a WASP. Well, stay safe, Jonesy. And good luck.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;To you, too, Lil.&#8221; We hugged for a long time. I promised to come visit, and then she was gone.</div></body></html>';

I leave my letter to Jolene unwritten and head across base to the officers&#8217; club, where I can get a cold Coca-Cola and enough warm bodies around me not to feel quite so alone.</div><div class="tx">This is Delaware. The air is damp and cool here. It smells like a summer rain might be on its way. I put my hands in my pockets and walk faster.</div><div class="tx">The door to the OC swings shut behind me.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, if it isn&#8217;t Jones.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Leave it open, we could use the breeze.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I peer into the afternoon gloom and see a blond head turned my way. It&#8217;s Audrey Hill, my old squadron leader from Avenger Field.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Audrey!&#8221; I rush toward her and our vigorous handshake becomes a hug.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s just like the old days at the Avengerette,&#8221; Audrey says. She&#8217;s smoking a cigarette and looks tired around the eyes, but I almost believe her.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You remember Randi?&#8221; She nods to the sultry redhead on the next bar stool, the same one she introduced me to that first night out on the town during training.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sure, I do. Men are the enemy, prepare to do battle,&#8221; I say echoing our last conversation.</div><div class="tx">Randi gives me a big smile. &#8220;Those were the days, weren&#8217;t they?&#8221; She shakes my hand.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Say, where&#8217;s the little gal you used to fly with . . . Lori, was it?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Lily.&#8221; I feel the temporary ban on my blues vanish. &#8220;Well, believe it or not, she got married and she&#8217;s having a baby.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s a one-way ticket home for sure,&#8221; Randi says.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Good for her,&#8221; Audrey exclaims. &#8220;See, Randi, that&#8217;s the way to do it. Find yourself a good man and settle down.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Randi snorts and I realize there&#8217;s rum in the Cokes they&#8217;ve been drinking.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been trying to do,&#8221; Randi replies.</div><div class="tx">I fidget with my shirt buttons. &#8220;So, what sorrow are you girls drowning today?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sorrow?&#8221; Audrey laughs. &#8220;No, we&#8217;re celebrating. You should join us.&#8221; She offers me the empty stool beside her. I sit down, glad of the company, even if it is tipsy.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Barkeep, a drink for the lady,&#8221; Audrey says, sounding more than a little like Patsy.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Coca-Cola, please,&#8221; I add.</div><div class="tx">When the drink comes, I hold it with both hands. I don&#8217;t seem to know what to do with them otherwise.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;So, what are we celebrating?&#8221; I ask again.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Operation Overlord, of course!&#8221; Audrey says, waving her glass in the air. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me you don&#8217;t listen to the news.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Or the scuttlebutt,&#8221; Randi adds.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, sure,&#8221; I reply. &#8220;But&#8212;&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Audrey interrupts me. &#8220;Nine hundred thousand men storming the beaches of France. We&#8217;ve broken the Nazi line, Jones.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;The war will be over in a week,&#8221; Randi exclaims.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hear, hear!&#8221; Audrey salutes her. &#8220;Bloody messy, though,&#8221; she adds more quietly. &#8220;We lost as many as we took.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;So I hear,&#8221; I say. It&#8217;s an understatement. Six thousand dead, and they&#8217;ve not finished counting the wounded. I take a sip of my cola. It&#8217;s gone flat. Quite a celebration.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I ferried some of the fighters they used in the cover mission,&#8221; I tell them. It was an Allied gamble that had worked. Eisenhower faked an attack up the coast of France with phony tanks and a few real planes. Hitler had his eyes on the northern town of Calais when the Allies stormed Normandy to the south.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Congratulations, Ida.&#8221; Audrey clinks her glass against mine. &#8220;Consider yourself a toe in the boot that kicked Hitler&#8217;s arse.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">For the first time, I smile. &#8220;I&#8217;ll drink to that.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Now, what else should we celebrate?&#8221; Randi asks. She looks like she&#8217;s celebrated plenty enough to me. But I remember my good news.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, I know. I&#8217;m off to Florida for officers&#8217; training. It looks like Jackie Cochran&#8217;s going to get us militarized after all,&#8221; I announce.</div><div class="tx">I raise my glass, but the other two girls just laugh.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Aw, Jones, don&#8217;t you know it&#8217;s just a show?&#8221; Audrey asks. &#8220;Like Eisenhower&#8217;s fake attack over Dover. Jackie thinks if she gets us into planes, the army will keep letting us fly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, they have, haven&#8217;t they?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sure, but not without a lot of complaints. Besides, you heard Randi. Scuttlebutt says if all goes well in France, this war will be over soon. The minute those soldiers come home, it&#8217;s all over for us WASP.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;It&#8217;s not,&#8221; I insist. &#8220;The men will come back, sure. But we&#8217;ve proven ourselves. We&#8217;re some of the best pilots they have. We fly safer than any of those flyboys.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sister, you&#8217;re preaching to the choir,&#8221; Audrey says.</div><div class="tx">Randi nods, her face pressed up against her glass. &#8220;What a world, what a world.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;We&#8217;ve <i>been</i> to officer school, Ida,&#8221; Audrey explains. &#8220;And look at us . . .&#8221; She waves her glass around the sad little room. &#8220;We&#8217;re lower than a couple of first-years. It&#8217;s enough to make you wonder why we ever even signed on in the first place.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I think of my handkerchief, back in my room, and wonder if I&#8217;ll be tying on another worry knot soon, but I say nothing. I sip my flat Coke. It tastes like metal on my tongue.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Go to Florida, have a good time,&#8221; Audrey suggests with a pat on my shoulder. &#8220;Get a tan. It&#8217;s fun. But if you wake up one day and you&#8217;re not an officer in this man&#8217;s army, remember that&#8217;s not why you signed on originally. It might take some of the sting out of it.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Randi rouses herself from where she&#8217;s slumped against the bar.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I did it for love.&#8221; She burps softly. &#8220;For the love of my daddy. Dear old Dad. He always wanted a boy.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Audrey nods. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m back at Slidell Methodist, listening to the women testify. &#8220;I did it for a fella,&#8221; Audrey confesses. &#8220;My ex-fianc&#233;, who said I didn&#8217;t &#8216;have the head or the heart&#8217; to fly.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You showed him,&#8221; Randi says, slapping her pal on the back.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What about you, Ida Mae Jones? Whatever made a pretty little thing like you want to go to Sweetwater?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I blink. It seems so obvious. &#8220;I wanted to fly, and my country needed me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Audrey smiles and shakes her head, like I&#8217;ve missed the punch line to some huge joke.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Really? Did the army ask for you? Did President Roosevelt send you a letter requesting your help?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I shake my head and look at my glass. Once upon a time, I thought that&#8217;s how it would be, but it wasn&#8217;t.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;They did for the Originals, you know,&#8221; Randi offers.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Nancy Love&#8217;s girls, the WAFS.&#8221; I nod. &#8220;So I&#8217;ve been told.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, then, Jones, why&#8217;d you come?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I frown at the glass in my lap. It&#8217;s getting warmer by the second, ice cubes melting away to nothing.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I came because I knew I could do it, and it beat sitting at home collecting silk stockings while my big brother was getting shot to bits in the Philippines.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Aha! <i>Cherchez l&#8217;homme,</i>&#8221; Randi cries triumphantly.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, indeed.&#8221; Audrey salutes me this time. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it funny, ladies, how there&#8217;s always a man at the bottom of everything we do? Why, I bet men do all kinds of things that don&#8217;t involve women.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Like fight wars.&#8221; Randi hiccups.</div><div class="tx">My head aches now, almost as much as my heart did when I came in. What Randi says used to be true, but not this time. Men are not the only soldiers in this fight. Whether they like it or not, whether the army wants it or not, we&#8217;re WASP. And we&#8217;re helping to end this war.</div><div class="tx">I finish my Coke and stand up. &#8220;The way I see it, ladies, we&#8217;re still in this one. Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;ve got to go see about a flight to Florida.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;To Florida!&#8221; Audrey and Randi clink their glasses together.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;All right, Jones,&#8221; Audrey says to me. &#8220;Safe journey. But don&#8217;t forget, we came to fight a war. When it&#8217;s over, go home  like a good little girl. Uncle Sam promises he&#8217;ll call us in the morning.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I leave them laughing at each other in the officers&#8217; club. It&#8217;s colder outside than early June should be, and it leaves me feeling uneasy. That feeling doesn&#8217;t go away until the next morning, as I board my plane to Florida.</div></body></html>';

Patsy and Lily aren&#8217;t with me, either. There are other WASP here, of course, even a few faces I recognize from Sweetwater and the places in between, but the most familiar face is one I least expect.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida! Ida Mae Jones!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Not many men know my name in Florida, especially since it&#8217;s only the first day of training. But a man is calling it out, clear as day, across the green paths between administrative buildings. I glance at my watch. I&#8217;m early for class, so I turn around and look for the source of the voice.</div><div class="tx">Walt Jenkins comes jogging across the quad toward me, a warm grin splitting his handsome face. I feel a flush rise in my cheeks. It&#8217;s good to see him. I&#8217;m just surprised at how good.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Instructor Jenkins!&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida,&#8221; he says, falling into step beside me. &#8220;Please, it&#8217;s Walt now.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Of course . . . Walt.&#8221; I blush again just saying it to his face. I clear my throat. &#8220;What brings you to Florida?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Same thing as you, I&#8217;m guessing. Officers&#8217; training?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I blink. &#8220;But you&#8217;re a civilian. And you already work for the army. Why would you enlist?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Drafted is more like it. We&#8217;re full to the top with flight  instructors, thanks to you girls being so damn good at your jobs. So, it was officers&#8217; school or the infantry. They still need men there.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">My blood goes a little cold. Being a foot soldier is as good as being dead in Europe or the Pacific. &#8220;You&#8217;re a smart man, Walter Jenkins.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Why, thank you, Miss Jones.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Unlike flight school, officers&#8217; training is coed. Simply not enough women to set up a whole new school, I guess. Walt Jenkins and I are in the same class. We reach our classroom and still have a few minutes, so we sit on a low brick wall and enjoy the warm breeze that is only slightly cooler than the hot still air. His shoulder brushes against mine and I want to lean against him. Somehow, it feels right to be by his side.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you made it down here,&#8221; Walt says. &#8220;And I was proud of the work you did on the B-29.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I feel a little tingle of pride. &#8220;You heard about that, did you? Lily Lowenstein was my co-pilot. Couldn&#8217;t have done it without her.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We nod and wave as more classmates arrive. One of them is Nancy Howard, from Sweetwater, the troublemaker from my barracks that Patsy was so very good at staring down. I haven&#8217;t seen Nancy since graduation, but she still looks like she&#8217;s trying to be Bette Davis. She smiles wide and bats her eyes at Instructor Jenkins before sitting on the other side of him. I feel a little territorial twinge in spite of myself. Nancy Howard strikes me as something of a man-eater.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Well, Walter Jenkins. I heard you&#8217;d be around here.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;You ladies can&#8217;t have all the fun,&#8221; he says.</div><div class="tx">Nancy laughs loudly. &#8220;Fun, right. The WASP bill is gonna  get killed in Congress next week. I&#8217;d rather spend my last days as a WASP in the air.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I lean forward to look at her. &#8220;So what if the bill doesn&#8217;t pass? I mean, we won&#8217;t be officers, but we&#8217;ll still be WASP. They need us.&#8221; Or, more likely, I need them. Without the WASP, this life, my life, is over. It&#8217;s back to Slidell and Jim Crow for me.</div><div class="tx">Nancy smiles, and it reminds me of the sand sharks Grandy used to pull from the Gulf of Mexico. I don&#8217;t smile back.</div><div class="tx">Walt shrugs. &#8220;This is war, ladies. Anything can happen.&#8221;</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">Anything can happen, he says. I make it through my first week of officers&#8217; training easily enough, but I wish it felt as good as I thought it would.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Why so thoughtful?&#8221; Walt asks me one day after class.</div><div class="tx">I shrug. It&#8217;s another beautiful Florida day, and all I can think about is how the fields must look back home, stripped of their early summer berries. I wrote a couple of letters to Mama and finally some to Jolene, but all I got back from her was silence. Too much was said for a few letters to wash away. Inside my pocket I absently finger the knots in my handkerchief, one for Patsy, one for Jolene. I&#8217;d miss the WASP if they were gone, but right now, I miss my family.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Just feeling worn down, I guess.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What? War&#8217;s not much fun anymore?&#8221; he asks with an impish grin. I can&#8217;t help but laugh. It turns out Walt Jenkins is very easy to be with when he&#8217;s not an instructor.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Yes, you could say that.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Walt gets a serious look on his face. &#8220;Well, what happens after this is all over for you? Do you have someone overseas you&#8217;re waiting for?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;No, nothing like that. My brother was fighting, but he&#8217;s home now, injured but alive.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s good.&#8221; We keep walking, and I realize we&#8217;re not really going anywhere. After so many charted courses and timed flights, it&#8217;s pleasant to be aimless for a little while. Walt smells like sunshine and Ivory soap. It reminds me of laundry drying on the line at home.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What about you? You must&#8217;ve left a family behind when you started teaching in Sweetwater.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Walt shrugs. &#8220;That would be Mrs. Jenkins, my mother. We were already living in Texas. I took her in when my dad passed away. She&#8217;s the reason I didn&#8217;t enlist in the first place. Teaching at Avenger was just as patriotic, and safer, too.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Will you go back to Texas, then?&#8221; We sit down under a eucalyptus tree, its fat green leaves filtering the light into a dappled blanket overhead, scenting the air with their sharp menthol smell. Walt sits close to me; our arms brush against each other as we lean back in the shade.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Not likely. Life down south starts to chafe after a while. I flew charter planes out west before the war. There&#8217;s a chance I might get to start my own business there.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;That&#8217;s swell, Walt.&#8221; I smile at him. &#8220;Imagine, flying for a living. What a dream.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">It&#8217;s Walt&#8217;s turn to smile. &#8220;I&#8217;ll need a few pilots, you know.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I laugh. &#8220;And here I thought we had more pilots than we could use.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">Walt shakes his head. &#8220;I&#8217;m serious, Ida. You&#8217;re a damn good pilot. Why not come fly for me?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I blink, surprised and pleased, but mostly surprised. &#8220;Well, for one thing, I&#8217;m a woman. You might be fine with that, but  will your customers be? And then, of course, there&#8217;s . . .&#8221; I fall silent. There&#8217;s the fact that I&#8217;m colored, and I never quite planned beyond the day I got into the WASP. Not once did I really think this charade of mine would outlast the war, let alone last a lifetime.</div><div class="tx">Walt Jenkins is looking at me, and his eyes are the same blue as the sky above. He&#8217;s a handsome man; I&#8217;ve said it before. But now I&#8217;m really seeing it. I remember our one awkward dance at the Avengerette last year and the whispering it caused. And I remember the rough warmth of his hand in mine, pulling me out of the Link that first day, making me feel safe. He&#8217;s leaning toward me, so close I can smell the warm, sharp scent of his aftershave. Close enough to kiss me . . . A part of me wakes up a little and says, Mrs. Walter Jenkins, co-owner of Jenkins Air.</div><div class="tx">I blush furiously, and Walt notices it.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;What was that?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Nothing. I . . . I have to go. But thanks for the walk . . .&#8221; I stand up and brush off my slacks. &#8220;And the talk . . . and . . . bye.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I walk back to my dorm as fast as I can, but not so fast that I don&#8217;t hear him call after me, &#8220;Think about what I said.&#8221;</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">The next two weeks are a dizzying time. Officer training fills my days, and I find my fingers itching to climb into a plane every night. I remember what Nancy Howard said. If these are our last weeks as WASP, she&#8217;d rather spend them flying. And so would I. But instead, I sit behind a little desk and look more and more the way Deatie Deaton did the first time I saw her at Avenger Field. Like a woman who got chained to the  ground when she should be in the sky. At first, I try to avoid Walt. There&#8217;s no future for me in his world, no matter how much I&#8217;d like there to be. But it&#8217;s impossible in a class our size. I get butterflies every time I see him, worse than any preflight jitters. The name Mrs. Walt Jenkins continues to float through my mind, but not seriously. No, it could never be thought of seriously.</div><div class="tx">On June 21, the WASP bill gets put to the vote. We lose. With one week left in officer training, I&#8217;m being sent back to Delaware to continue my ferrying duties. I show up at my last day of class to say goodbye to Walt. I&#8217;m not the only WASP being sent home.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Call me, Ida Mae.&#8221; Walt pushes a slip of paper into my hand. &#8220;Or write. Just promise me you&#8217;ll get in touch after the war.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I smile at him a little weakly. Maybe all he&#8217;s interested in is my flying after all.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Sure, Walt. Just stay in one piece, okay?&#8221;</div><div class="tx">We&#8217;re in front of the administration building where our classes are held. All around us, the other girls are saying goodbye to each other. It&#8217;s like a scene from a train station. I reach out and shake Walt&#8217;s hand. It&#8217;s as warm as I remember from our dance.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Ida,&#8221; he says, his voice so low I almost don&#8217;t hear him. &#8220;Promise me.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">When he kisses me, it&#8217;s so quick, so brief I don&#8217;t know how to react. Just a brush of his lips against my cheek. Then he lets go of my hand and walks away. I stare after him until the crowd is all I see. I can still feel his hand in mine. This is what Jolene was talking about. What Lily felt about Harry.  For the first time in my life, I feel like I&#8217;m flying with both of my feet firmly on the ground.</div><div>&#160;<br></br></div><div class="tx1">My transport doesn&#8217;t leave until nightfall, so I have the afternoon to myself. I borrow a car and make the drive to visit Patsy&#8217;s grave. The entire way, I think of Walt and of Grandm&#232;re Boudreaux, and I finally understand why she never came down our driveway. In New Orleans, maybe in the rest of the world, too, white women don&#8217;t have brown-skinned grandchildren any more than colored women get to have white husbands in Texas. Life isn&#8217;t black and white. It&#8217;s black  <i>or</i> white. Anything else is just a mess.</div><div class="tx">I reach the orange orchards that lie south of Patsy&#8217;s cemetery. The trees are sweet with fruit that hangs like bright little suns beneath the shining leaves. I breathe in through the open window. It tastes surprisingly sweet and bitter at the same time. It&#8217;s a familiar feeling.</div><div class="tx">I park at the base of the small knoll that marks the beginning of the graveyard and walk the rest of the way through the thick St. Augustine grass. It feels like a spongy carpet beneath my feet.</div><div class="tx">A simple headstone marks the grave of my friend. Seeing it makes my eyes sting. <i>PATSY &#8220;CAKEWALK&#8221; KAKE. THE SKY IS HER HOME.</i> I sit down next to her grave and rest my forehead on the cool, cool stone.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Hiya, Patsy. It&#8217;s me, Ida Mae. I mean, Jonesy. Gee, no one calls me that anymore. I&#8217;m just plain old Ida or Jones. Lily&#8217;s left us. She and Harry got married on the fly, and she&#8217;s gonna have a baby. If it&#8217;s a girl, I&#8217;m guessing she&#8217;ll name her after you. Don&#8217;t tell Harry, though. He wants it to be Hannah, after  his grandmother.&#8221; I smile, remembering how worried Lily was over this prospect.</div><div class="tx">&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;d be jealous, though. Lily and I got to fly the B-29. Boy, was that a devil to lift off. And it lost two engines on the way down, but we flew her all right just the same.&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I fold my arms beneath my head to make a pillow against the stone. &#8220;More news about the WASP, too. They won&#8217;t make us military. There&#8217;s a good chance they won&#8217;t make us anything at all soon, from what everybody&#8217;s saying. And I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do, Patsy. Lily has Harry, but my best friend from back home isn&#8217;t even speaking to me. And then there&#8217;s Walt Jenkins. Don&#8217;t laugh, but I think he likes me. Maybe even more than a little. But I don&#8217;t think it will work . . .&#8221;</div><div class="tx">I can feel the tears streaming down my face, blurring the sunny sky above me. &#8220;The thing is, Patsy, I&#8217;m not who I&#8217;ve said I am. Not what I said I was. I mean . . .&#8221; I can&#8217;t say it. I don&#8217;t want to say it.</div><div class="tx">Because I don&#8217;t feel Negro any more than I feel white. I&#8217;m just me. Ida Mae Jones, and I&#8217;m blue. Santiago blue. Take away the uniform and I really am nothing at all. Take away the wings and I&#8217;m someone else&#8217;s. Someone&#8217;s maid, someone&#8217;s daughter, someone&#8217;s sister, and maybe even someone&#8217;s wife one day. But I can&#8217;t have one life without giving up the other. I can fly and be with Walt or be with my family and never fly again. It&#8217;s not fair. Mama and Jolene tried to warn me. Lies breed lies. If I go with Walt, I&#8217;ll have to keep on lying. But I can&#8217;t imagine going home again, cleaning the Wilsons&#8217; house for the rest of my days. That feels like a lie, too.</div><div class="tx">I cry for a long time over Patsy&#8217;s grave, but she is not the only one I&#8217;m mourning. I miss the three of us, Patsy, Lily, and me, and I miss Jolene and Mama. I cry for Thomas and his shattered leg, for Abel, who&#8217;s still got to grow up in this kind of world. I cry for my daddy and for Walt, for lying to my new friends and leaving my old ones behind. I cry for everything I&#8217;ve ever known and loved.</div><div class="tx">And then, somewhere at the end of all that crying, I fall asleep. And I dream of a deep blue sky. And when I wake up, I remember what Audrey said to me at the officers&#8217; club three weeks ago. When this is all over, remember why you signed on in the first place. And I do remember, exactly what I told Patsy when she asked me why I was there. I came to fly.</div><div class="tx">I take my handkerchief out of my pocket and gently pull apart all of the knots. It&#8217;s a wrinkled mess now, like a topographical map of sorrowful mountains, not even clear enough to navigate by. I smooth it out, trace my fingers along the blue threads that spell out my name. I wipe my eyes, stand up, dust myself off, and walk back down through the spongy grass to the car.</div><div class="tx">I&#8217;ve promised Walt a letter, and he&#8217;ll get one when this war is over. I&#8217;ll tell him the truth. He&#8217;ll have to decide what to make of it for himself, what to make of me. Lily was right&#8212;I was born to be a WASP, and that is part of who I am. But I was also born to be Ida Mae Jones, that skinny little colored girl who learned to fly her father&#8217;s airplane over the fields of her hometown. That old Jenny is still waiting for me, under a sheet in a dusty barn. And Mama, and Grandy, and my brothers are waiting, too. Maybe even Jolene. I just have to find the right words to say to everyone. But there will be time enough  for reckonings when this day&#8217;s work is done. For now, I&#8217;m traveling light.</div><div class="tx">The drive doesn&#8217;t take as long on the way back, which is good. Because no matter how much of it seems like it&#8217;s over, I&#8217;ve got my duty, and this is still a war. Whatever the future may bring, for the time being, I still get to fly.</div></body></html>';

A plane that, until Lily and I flew it, they were too scared to fly. The payload was something new, something called an atom bomb. Thomas heard from a friend that it blew down half the city like paper, men, women, children and all. Hitler dead in his bunker, and Japan brought to its knees like that . . . How something so awful can bring about peace, I&#8217;ll never know. Any more than I&#8217;ll ever figure out how the army disbanded the WASP. But here we are.</div><div class="bmtx">I dropped a letter in the mail today, a letter to Walter Jenkins, formerly of the U.S. Army. The war is over. All of our boys can finally come home.

While I took great license with events and names, here are a few factual notes.</div><div class="bmtx">First of all, the acronym <i>WASP</i> is both singular and plural. Since it stands for &#8220;Women Airforce Service Pilots&#8221; with an <i>s,</i>  to add another would be redundant!</div><div class="bmtx">The WASP program was part of the United States Army, as was all other military aviation during the first two world wars. The United States Air Force, as we know it today, was not established as a separate branch of the military until 1947.</div><div class="bmtx">The two WASP actually assigned to learn how to fly the B-29 were Dora Dougherty Strother and Dorothea Johnson Moorman. The plane they flew was dubbed <i>Ladybird</i> and they flew several trips, from Alabama to New Mexico, before the army put a stop to the &#8220;stunt.&#8221; In the story, when Lily and Ida overhear a soldier dub the B-29 &#8220;another Widowmaker,&#8221; he is referring to the accident-prone B-26 Marauder&#8212;another plane the WASP proved they could successfully fly.</div><div class="bmtx">In 1941, Russian women began flying military missions for their country. By the end of the war, they had earned the name &#8220;Night Witches&#8221; for their nighttime bombing runs against the Nazis. The United States Air Force did not allow women to fly combat missions until the mid-1990s.</div><div class="bmtx">Bessie Coleman, Jackie Cochran, Deatie Deaton, General  Hap Arnold, Doc Monserud, and Nancy Love are all real people. Read more about them in Amy Nathan&#8217;s wonderful book,  <i>Yankee Doodle Girls,</i> Marianne Verges&#8217;s <i>On Silver Wings</i>&#8212;to which I owe the wonderful WASP song the girls sing on the way to the airstrip&#8212;and many of the other reference books listed on my website, <a href="http://www.sherrilsmith.com">www.sherrilsmith.com</a>. For more information on the true WASP, visit the WASP website,  <a href="http://www.wingsacrossamerica.org">www.wingsacrossamerica.org</a>, and the National WASP WWII Museum at <a href="http://www.waspmuseum.org">www.waspmuseum.org</a>.</div><div class="bmtx">Hazel Ah Ying, the Chinese WASP who inspires Ida Mae to join, was one of two Asians accepted into the WASP program, Maggie Gee being the other. Hazel was killed in the line of duty. There is rumored to have been one Latina in the program as well, but I have found no name to put to the rumor. There is no evidence that any African-American women were a part of the WASP program, either by &#8220;passing&#8221; or being accepted regardless of their race.</div><div class="bmtx">Janet Harmon Bragg is an African-American pilot who was rejected by the WASP program solely on the basis of race. She is the inspiration for the woman Ida Mae sees at the recruitment office. Mrs. Bragg learned to fly at Coffey School of Aeronautics in Chicago, where Ida Mae&#8217;s father attended. She went on to teach aviation to schoolchildren, but it was not her primary career.</div><div class="bmtx">Of the women who flew in the WASP program, most went back to their lives on the ground&#8212;housewives, secretaries. A few found work as flight instructors, and some moved to Alaska, where the new frontier had room for female bush pilots.</div><div class="bmtx">The WASP bill was finally passed in 1977, under President Jimmy Carter&#8217;s administration, officially militarizing the  WASP. The women who had served their country more than thirty years before, who had been forced to pay for their own funerals when denied military benefits, were finally given honorable discharges and full veterans&#8217; rights. At long last, the passing of the WASP bill paved the road the women of the WASP had forged years before, making way for the hundreds of female pilots of all races in the United States military today.</div></body></html>';

Weekends, even summer weekends, were meant for sleeping in ... especially when those weekends were spent hanging out super late under the full moon because your vampire genes won&#x2019;t let you go to bed before they&#x2019;ve had their fill of nighttime. Even more so when you only had a matter of days before the joy of summer would be over and the dread of school would begin.</div><div class="tx">A low, buzzing sound drifted over his face, paused, then moved again toward his right ear. He popped open one eye and glared in disgust at the housefly that was hovering about the room. So that&#x2019;s what had woken him.</div><div class="tx">The fly fluttered over and landed on the tip of Vlad&#x2019;s nose.

Henry, watch Vlad while I&#x2019;m gone. He&#x2019;s a trouble-maker.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Vlad&#x2019;s jaw dropped in mock exasperation. &#x201c;Nelly!&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Nelly smiled sweetly. &#x201c;I mean, he&#x2019;s a wonderful boy who brightens my day and makes life worth living.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">After she slipped out the front door, Vlad eyed the wicked glimmer in Henry&#x2019;s eye suspiciously. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Henry&#x2019;s grin broadened. &#x201c;Did you call Meredith yet?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Vlad straightened his shoulders proudly. &#x201c;Twice, actually.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Henry watched him for a moment, the surprise in his eyes quickly giving way to suspicion. &#x201c;You talked to her?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Talk to her? Vlad hadn&#x2019;t yet figured out a way to remove the lump that had taken up residence in his throat ever since she&#x2019;d leaned in for a kiss after the Freedom Fest dance and he&#x2019;d backed away, babbling like some kind of deranged lunatic. Talking to her was the least of his problems. First he needed to figure out how to breathe whenever she was near.</div><div class="tx">Vlad slowly stretched his hand out and picked up his mug, then took a long drink before returning it to the table. When he was finished, he met Henry&#x2019;s eyes and sighed. &#x201c;Nope. Hung up both times. I think she heard me breathing once though.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">&#x201c;That&#x2019;s progress.&#x201d; Henry sighed. &#x201c;You know she has caller ID, right?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Vlad&#x2019;s eyes grew wide. There it was again, that lump in his throat. &#x201c;She does?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Henry answered with a tone of indifference. &#x201c;Yeah. But dude, check this out.&#x201d; He grinned wickedly and lowered his voice to a tone of conspiracy. &#x201c;Last night, Greg told me something interesting about the upperclassmen girls.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Vlad leaned up against the counter and tried to act like he wasn&#x2019;t completely curious. &#x201c;Interesting? Like how?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Henry leaned closer. &#x201c;He says that if you can get invited to one of the senior parties, that some of those girls take pity on the lower classmen and they&#x2019;ll&#x2014;&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Aunt Nelly walked into the kitchen. In one hand was a stack of envelopes, in the other was a small brown box. She glanced at their frozen, startled expressions and raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;What are you boys talking about?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">They answered in one wavering voice, &#x201c;Nothing!&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Vlad eyed the envelopes hopefully. &#x201c;Anything from Otis?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Nelly sighed and shook her head as she flipped through the stack. &#x201c;Honestly, Vladimir. Your uncle has written to you at least once a week since the day he left Bathory. Do you really think he&#x2019;d forget about you now?&#x201d; She pulled a thick parchment envelope from the pile and held it out to him with a smile.</div><div class="tx">Vlad sighed in relief. He&#x2019;d only just met his uncle last year, after a horrible misunderstanding. Vlad had no idea Otis was his uncle at the time, instead believing him to be a maniacal substitute teacher, out to expose Vlad&#x2019;s secret and quite possibly kill him. It was a simple mistake&#x2014;anyone could have made it. Instead, Otis had been protecting him from D&#x2019;Ablo, the president of an Elysian council, who was determined to find Vlad and punish him for the crime of existing.</div><div class="tx">Apparently, vampires aren&#x2019;t really big on the idea of humans and vampires having kids together.</div><div class="tx">Ever since Otis had left town in order to flee from Elysia and away from vampirekind, Vlad and Otis had exchanged many letters. In them, Otis had taught him how to read the vampiric language, otherwise known as Elysian code, and had urged him to practice his telepathy daily. Vlad was grateful for all of these things.</div><div class="tx">Of course, Otis had also recently encouraged Vlad to work on controlling the minds of others. Vlad was intrigued&#x2014;there was no doubt about that. But there was one aspect that Otis hadn&#x2019;t thought about. What if Vlad got caught? The ability to control the thoughts and actions of other people could hardly be blamed on your normal, everyday teenage hormones.</div><div class="tx">Still . . . it might make algebra easier to pass.</div><div class="tx">But rather than explain his fear of being discovered, Vlad had written his uncle several weeks ago and insisted that he was incapable of controlling the minds of others, hoping that Otis would accept it as a lost cause and move on to some of the stealthier abilities of the undead. Like animorphing . . . or maybe luring females with a glance.</div><div class="tx">He tore open the envelope and after squinting at Otis&#x2019;s crooked handwriting for a moment&#x2014;it always took him some time to adjust his eyes&#x2014;he read.</div><div class="atx"><i>Dearest Vladimir</i>,</div><div class="atx"><i>I hope this letter finds you well. To answer your  most recent questions: (1) No</i>,<i> there has been no further  word from Elysia concerning you or your father. However</i>,<i> you must remember that I am no longer privilegedto information concerning the legal procedures  of the Stokerton council. All of my information is hearsayand</i>,<i> therefore</i>,<i> not completely reliable. (2) Your  aunt is right to be so &#x201c;overprotective&#x201d; and insist that  you go nowhere alone.

Besides</i>,<i> it is possible that  Elysia may decide to exact vengeance for your murder  of their president last year . . . despite the fact that it  was self-defense. (3) I&#x2019;m sorry</i>,<i> Vladimir</i>,<i> but the rumor </i> <i>that vampires are able to charm women with a leeringgaze is utterly ridiculous and completely false.  Have you tried simply asking Meredith if she likes  you? In my experience</i>,<i> the direct approach works best.  Calling a girl and breathing into the phone never got  anyone a date. Whatever you decide</i>,<i> remember to be  a gentleman.</i></div><div class="atx"><i>As promised</i>,<i> I am enclosing further instructions on  how to best develop your telepathic skills. It surprises  me that you have had only minimal success with this  trait</i>,<i> as you should be able to read the minds of anyoneyou wish</i>,<i> but we must both remember that you  are the first of your kind</i>,<i> Vladimir</i>,<i> and things will  likely be different for you. When vampires are made</i>, <i>there is a natural order to their skill development</i>,<i> but  you . . . you were born</i>,<i> and as such</i>,<i> we cannot be certainwhich traits you will inherit from your father&#x2019;s  vampire nature</i>,<i> and which you will not</i>,<i> due to your  mother&#x2019;s human DNA. We must deal with each of  these skills as it presents itself.</i></div><div class="atx"><i>Follow the enclosed instructions and practice</i>,<i> practice</i>, <i>practice! However</i>,<i> as your former teacher</i>,<i> I must insist  that you refrain from using your telepathy as a means  to better grades. And yes</i>,<i> I&#x2019;ll know. Trust me.</i></div><div class="atx"><i>As for the issues you seem to be having with mind  control</i>,<i> give me time to compose some helpful tips </i> <i>regarding this skill. Together</i>,<i> we&#x2019;ll find a way to  make this possible. Your father was quite adept at doingthis. I confess that it surprises me that you may  not be. But please know that I am not disappointed in  the least.</i></div><div class="atx"><i>You are always in my thoughts</i>,<i> Vlad. Please take  care of yourself.

According to the phrase coined by the notable humanphilosopher George Santayana</i>,<i> &#x201c;Those who cannotremember the past are condemned to repeat it.&#x201d;</i></div><div class="atx"><i>Next week I will be in London&#x2014;the address where I  can be reached is enclosed.

It was the same closing his dad had used in every note, every book, every birthday card, he&#x2019;d ever given to Vlad. Vlad felt the looming shadow of grief sweep over him again. The death of a loved one is funny like that. It doesn&#x2019;t matter how much you grieve or how much time has passed, the littlest reminder of the person who died&#x2014;a scent, an object, a word&#x2014;can send you back to the moment you lost them, and before you can blink, you&#x2019;re overcome by the aching sadness you worked so hard to leave behind.</div><div class="tx">It was pretty disheartening to learn that dueling to the death last year against D&#x2019;Ablo might set vampire society on his heels, despite the fact that D&#x2019;Ablo had started the whole mess in the first place and Vlad had only blown a hole through him with the Lucis to avoid having D&#x2019;Ablo rip one through him with his bare hands. But Vlad could deal with that. After all, thanks to Otis, Elysia thought Vlad was human, not half-vampire. Of course, Otis had said that what with Vlad possessing the Lucis, the most dangerous weapon against vampirekind, Elysia was pretty anxious to agree that he was human, to deny the notion that he was even remotly capable of hurting them, giving them little reason to chase after Vlad.</div><div class="tx">It was frustrating to learn that his uncle had absolutely no sensible advice regarding Vlad&#x2019;s current situation with the girl he liked. He thought about asking Nelly for her input, but the last thing he needed was a two-hour conversation about when Nelly was a teenager.</div><div class="tx">Vlad sighed. It was hopeless. How was he ever going to explain to Meredith that he had no idea why he hadn&#x2019;t kissed her after Freedom Fest dance last year, and that the only reason he hadn&#x2019;t returned her calls over the summer was that she would ask him to explain his inaction . . . and he couldn&#x2019;t. How was he supposed to explain something to her that even he didn&#x2019;t understand?</div><div class="tx">&#x201c;What did he say?&#x201d; Henry peered over Vlad&#x2019;s shoulder at the parchment.</div><div class="tx">Vlad folded the letter and shoved it back in the envelope, then withdrew the instructions. &#x201c;He says to tell Nelly hi and that he&#x2019;s enclosed some tips on telepathy.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Nelly smiled warmly and blushed, then glanced at her watch and sighed. She shook her head and reached for her purse. On her way out the door, she called behind her, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m late. I was supposed to take Deb&#x2019;s shift at the hospital this afternoon. Can you boys fend for dinner?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">The door closed before they could answer.</div><div class="tx">Henry nodded toward Otis&#x2019;s instructions. &#x201c;You wanna try something out? I&#x2019;ve been dying to know if Melissa Hart likes me.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Vlad folded the notes up and slipped them in his back jeans pocket. &#x201c;I want to study the notes first for a few days. Maybe we&#x2019;ll try something this weekend.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Henry groaned. &#x201c;Come on! I&#x2019;m busy this weekend. Joss, remember?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">&#x201c;I want to read them first.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">&#x201c;So read them. Then we can head over to the mall in Stokerton. Melissa is doing that &#x2018;end of summer/fall fashion&#x2019; show they do every year, and you&#x2014;&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">&#x201c;Henry, I said no.&#x201d; Vlad&#x2019;s eyes were fixed on Henry. His tone was stern.</div><div class="tx">Henry nodded slowly and reached for his orange juice.</div><div class="tx">Drudge or not, Vlad hated giving Henry direct orders, and he only did it if Henry was being too pushy about something Vlad didn&#x2019;t feel like doing or discussing . . . or if Vlad really wanted a Pepsi, but he really didn&#x2019;t feel like going into the kitchen to get one. Other than that, their vampire/vampire&#x2019;s-human-slave relationship was working out pretty well. It was astounding how well Henry had taken the news that with one bite, he&#x2019;d become Vlad&#x2019;s drudge.</div><div class="tx">But then, maybe Henry had only taken it so well because Vlad had told him to.</div><div class="tx">The thought made Vlad shiver. He didn&#x2019;t like the idea of controlling Henry&#x2019;s actions. Truthfully, it creeped him out a little. But sometimes Henry could be so pushy.</div><div class="tx">Vlad flipped over the box and, spying his name on the label, proceeded to pop the flaps open. His lips spread into a grin, and he looked at Henry. &#x201c;You wanna play<i> Race to  Armageddon 2</i>?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Henry gasped at the game box in Vlad&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;No way!&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Vlad flipped the game over and looked at the screen shots. &#x201c;They say it&#x2019;s twice the action, three times the gore.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Exchanging maniacal grins, they bolted for the living room.</div><div class="tx">Two hours, a bag of Doritos, seven Pepsis, and four bags of blood later, Vlad and Henry sat their controllers down and stretched. Henry&#x2019;s eyes were wide with awed disgust. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s so gross. I love it!&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">&#x201c;No doubt. It&#x2019;s so cool that the androids can fly now.&#x201d; Vlad drained his Pepsi and sat the empty can on the coffee table. His stomach rumbled.</div><div class="tx">Henry furrowed his brow. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s with the alien king having six heads? That&#x2019;s new. He&#x2019;s gonna be tough to beat this time.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">&#x201c;They really added a lot of blood. Speaking of which . . .&#x201d; Vlad retrieved another bag of blood from the refrigerator. As he was walking back into the living room, he let his fangs elongate&#x2014;his hunger was pulsing beneath them. He bit through the bag and drained it, then let out a burp and wiped the excess from the corners of his mouth.</div><div class="tx">Henry chuckled. &#x201c;Pig.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Vlad snickered. &#x201c; &#x2019;Scuse me.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Henry bit his lip thoughtfully for a moment. His tone became careful and serious. &#x201c;Do you think you&#x2019;ll ever start feeding on people?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Vlad shook his head. &#x201c;No way. Not in a million years.&#x201d; He eyed Henry for a moment with his peripheral vision before facing him. &#x201c;You actually think I&#x2019;d do that?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">&#x201c;Well, you<i> did </i>bite me when we were eight.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Vlad flashed Henry an incredulous look. &#x201c;Dude, we were <i>eight</i>. Besides, you told me to.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Henry pretended not to hear him. &#x201c;And just now, before you bit into that bag, your eyes changed that weird iridescent purple the way they do when you touch a glyph.&#x201d; Henry nodded to the strange symbol on the cover of the <i>Encyclopedia Vampyrica </i>and shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying it&#x2019;s possible. I mean, what if the bags and snack packs aren&#x2019;t enough anymore?&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Vlad shook his head and pressed his lips tightly together, tracing the glyphlike tattoo on the inside of his left wrist lightly. There was a long moment of silence before he spoke. &#x201c;If they were good enough for my dad to live on, they&#x2019;re good enough for me. Besides, the day I start feeding on people is the day I start beating you at video games.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Henry laughed and picked up his controller. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re saying it&#x2019;ll never happen.&#x201d;</div></body></html>';

There was always the slight chance that Joss would interfere with his and Henry&#x2019;s time together, or worse, that he and Joss might not get along.</div></body></html>';

Adjusting his backpack into a more comfortable position on his shoulder, Vlad took a deep breath and walked into the school.</div><div class="tx">Along either side of the lobby were thirteen large stone pillars, with arches between each at the top.

But he remembered clearly that it had been the day of her funeral that he&#x2019;d been sworn in as a slayer, and just before the final blow in every battle with a vampire, he&#x2019;d uttered the words, &#x201c;For you, Cecile.&#x201d;</div></body></html>';

They were all in fine order. Apart from being a little low on holy water, the slayer was ready. He turned the stake over in his hands and smirked at a passing memory of an old film, in which a slayer was portrayed as a bumbling fool with a sack full of splintered wood. How ridiculous. A true slayer needed only one stake to take a blood drinker down. One stake and good aim. The heart is a small organ and, what&#x2019;s more, hidden behind the ribs. If you don&#x2019;t hit it just right, you&#x2019;re going to have a very angry vampire on your hands. And nobody wants that.</div><div class="tx">He remembered one of his first slayings with a sigh. It had gone well. He&#x2019;d staked the vampire. No fuss, no muss. But after he turned to collect his tools he heard a noise. Whistling. He turned back to the undead monster. The whistling got louder. Something was wrong.</div></body></html>';

The more the vampire exerted itself to stand, the louder it whistled. It was like doing battle with the little engine that wants to drink your blood. He staked the monster again and had burned the body, just to be safe.</div><div class="tx">He slipped the stake back into its spot in the walnut case and moved on to the other tools, wiping each off with the corner of the cloth before returning it home.

After all, it was pretty easy to get freaked out on Halloween, what with all the stories going around this time of year about werewolves, ghosts, and vampires.</div><div class="tx">Vlad swallowed nervously.</div><div class="tx">&#x201c;Well, well, well. Look what we have here, Tom.&#x201d; At Bill&#x2019;s first word, Vlad opened his eyes and sat up, but Bill shoved him back down on the bench with an open, heavy hand.</div><div class="tx">Above him, quickly blocking his view of the moon, was Bill&#x2019;s bulbous head, grinning with an evil glint in his eye. Joining him after a second was a sinister-looking Tom. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna get it now, goth boy.&#x201d;</div></body></html>';

Bill shook him, and he glanced at the house, wondering how likely it would be they&#x2019;d get interrupted by one of Matthew&#x2019;s parents.

Serious trouble.</div><div class="tx">Before Vlad knew what was coming, he felt the meaty thud of Bill&#x2019;s fist against his jaw.</div><div class="tx">It didn&#x2019;t hurt. Not really. But Vlad&#x2019;s face grew very warm and his jaw tingled with something that might have been pain if it hadn&#x2019;t been for his rising temper. Wriggling out of Bill&#x2019;s grip, Vlad dropped to the ground and tried to stand, but Tom stepped closer and punched him hard in the stomach.</div><div class="tx"><i>That </i>hurt.</div><div class="tx">And for a moment, Vlad couldn&#x2019;t breathe.</div></body></html>';

Vlad&#x2019;s stomach rumbled. His throat felt dry, parched with an almost uncontrollable thirst. He kept his mouth closed and glared with his uncovered eye at his attackers. He was pretty sure he could duck by Tom and make it to the sidewalk, but what then? Those jerks punched each other for fun and could run faster than you&#x2019;d think two refrigerators could move. He needed a plan. And he needed it fast.</div><div class="tx">His eye pulsed against his palm. His heart was hammering so hard against the inside of his chest that it seemed one long, continuous beat. He took a step to the left, and Bill and Tom followed suit. Vlad pursed his lips.

Tom stomped hard on the center of Vlad&#x2019;s chest, and the memory of what it had felt like when D&#x2019;Ablo broke one of his ribs pierced his imagination.

A girl&#x2019;s voice rose above the others. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you, Sprat, it&#x2019;s haunted. That&#x2019;s why they closed the old church.

He crammed three into wax-covered candlesticks and lit them before flopping onto his dad&#x2019;s old office chair and running his fingers over the soft leather. It hadn&#x2019;t been easy getting the chair up to the belfry. He&#x2019;d managed to wheel it from his old house to the high school without much trouble, but lugging the large chair up four stories while levitating had proven challenging, to say the least. In the end, he&#x2019;d sworn A LOT, and then taken a screwdriver to the chair. After it was split into five pieces, he&#x2019;d carried each piece up separately and reassembled it in the belfry.</div><div class="tx">It was tough but well worth it.

Beneath it lay Vlad&#x2019;s own journal, in which he scribbled his private thoughts and experiences, hoping in some small way to emulate his father. The composition notebook he used as a journal was nearly full of entries and frayed at the edges, but Vlad hadn&#x2019;t saved up enough cash to buy a refillable leather version yet.</div><div class="tx">On the stack next to the journals was a framed photo.

Music thumped in a continuous rhythm, shaking the flame of his candle. How could he expect to focus on reading when several floors below, in Bathory High&#x2019;s gym, Meredith was likely twirling around the dance floor at the annual Snow Ball with her handsome, charming, what-a-swell-guy date? And Vlad, who&#x2019;d been too chicken to even approach the thought of asking Meredith out again, was left alone and dateless while his two best friends were busy downstairs with dates of their own. It was a rather pathetic situation to be in, so Vlad did the next best thing to attending the semiformal dance alone&#x2014;he went to his secret sanctuary in the belfry to mope.</div><div class="tx">Vlad had every right to mope. Henry had scored a date with a pretty blonde junior whose twin sister happened to have an enormous crush on Henry&#x2019;s brother, Greg.</div></body></html>';

Not that he deserved it. Not that anyone deserved a night out with Meredith Brookstone.</div><div class="tx">For about two seconds after hearing that Joss would be taking Meredith to the dance, Vlad hated them both with a deep passion. Then he felt an immediate mixture of guilt, stupidity, and self-loathing. Vlad should have asked Meredith to the dance weeks ago. But after their last date, he didn&#x2019;t have much hope in the world that she&#x2019;d actually say yes anyway.</div><div class="tx">Vlad tried keeping quiet about his feelings, but every time Joss would ask him if he could believe that Meredith had asked him out, Vlad screamed<i> NO! </i>inside his skull. And Joss couldn&#x2019;t seem to take a hint. So finally, he&#x2019;d snapped back one day at lunch that no, he couldn&#x2019;t believe she&#x2019;d actually asked him out, because who in their right mind thinks anthropologists are hot?</div></body></html>';

His breath formed small clouds of fog in front of his lips. The belfry was freezing, but he wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to sit at home and watch Nelly busy herself with holiday baking. Besides, the idea that he was probably the only person besides Eddie Poe who hadn&#x2019;t gone to the dance had made him feel particularly mopey&#x2014;so, vampire slayer or not, Vlad had gripped the Lucis in his hand and threw glances over his shoulder at every tree, every bush, the entire way here.</div></body></html>';

The buckles on the backs of his fingerless gloves shined in the low light. Beside him, his father&#x2019;s portrait watched with a smile. The candle&#x2019;s flame shrank and, with a brief burst of light, went out. It was as if the belfry were telling him it was time to give up moping and go home.

He recognized Henry right away, despite the fact that Henry&#x2019;s face was buried in a scary-looking kiss with the blonde junior. They looked to be attached by suction cups that had been affixed to their faces. Try as they might to break free, Henry and the junior were trapped. And Vlad was pretty sure they were happy with their predicament.</div><div class="tx">But it was possible that they were attempting to gnaw each other&#x2019;s lips off.

Why on earth would Chelsea Whitaker think she knew anything at all about Vlad when the expanse of their interaction had been Chelsea making snide comments about Vlad and pulling stupid pranks that always seemed to land Vlad in detention?

He and Vikas had spent several long days inside the darkened, silent room, and Vlad had opened up to the possibilities that mind control, when used with honorable purpose, could be a handy skill to possess. In the room, he was great at it. Vlad once made Tristian take a break from his duties and, much to Vikas&#x2019;s bemusement, he made one of the vampires burst into song. But it was hard work, not to mention exhausting. Plus, it was almost impossible for him to control anyone&#x2019;s mind once outside of the training room. When he told Vikas about having made Henry pick his nose once, Vikas explained that a drudge is the easiest person for a vampire to control. After he stopped laughing, of course.</div></body></html>';

Just because I&#x2019;m mad at you doesn&#x2019;t mean we&#x2019;re not friends.&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Immense relief crossed Joss&#x2019;s eyes.

As the numbers switched to 12:01, Vlad bent down and slid on his tennis shoes, tying them haphazardly.</div><div class="tx">He didn&#x2019;t exactly want to be outside in the middle of the night&#x2014;especially if Joss was out and about, looking for a vampire to stab in the chest with his wooden stake&#x2014;but he didn&#x2019;t have much choice in the matter.

Besides, doing anything out of the ordinary might clue Joss in to Vlad&#x2019;s unusual dining habits.</div><div class="tx">His shoes finally tied, Vlad plucked the Lucis from atop his dresser and crept out of his bedroom into the library. There was a line of light coming from under Nelly&#x2019;s bedroom door. He closed his door behind him and was two steps from the top of the stairs when Amenti darted from the darkness and swatted his ankle. Vlad whispered harshly, &#x201c;Amenti! Stop that!&#x201d;</div><div class="tx">Amenti gave him another good whack with her paw before darting down the stairs. Vlad looked at Nelly&#x2019;s door.

It was warm enough for Vlad to forgo his jacket, but by the time he reached downtown, Vlad wished he&#x2019;d brought it anyway. There was something oddly comforting about heavy denim against your skin. And comfort was one thing he wasn&#x2019;t finding on his walk to the cemetery.</div><div class="tx">He hadn&#x2019;t made this walk in an entire year, but he&#x2019;d repeated this same trip three times now, once a year on the anniversary of the accident.

Short brick walls sat at either side of the entrance, and twisted black wrought iron arched over the dirt path that led inside. At the top of the arch, bold letters identified what lay ahead as LONG ROAD CEMETERY. Vlad had no idea where the name had come from. There wasn&#x2019;t a Long Road in any part of Bathory. But, he thought with a gulp, it certainly was an honest, if not somewhat morbid, name for a place where people bury their dead.</div></body></html>';

Nothing.</div><div class="tx">Halfway up the main path, Vlad paused to look around. The cemetery was overgrown with weeds, and dead ivy and moss hung from the tree trunks. To his left stood a large block-shaped tombstone. Atop it sat a stone woman. In her hand was a wreath of some sort. In the moonlight, she seemed alive, and with a shiver, Vlad waited for her to move.</div><div class="tx">To his immense relief, she didn&#x2019;t.</div><div class="tx">To his right was a gravestone that looked like a book, and beside it, one topped with a statue in the shape of a small lamb.</div></body></html>';

Vlad turned his head and saw the large, twisted oak tree that marked where his parents&#x2019; graves lay. He stepped onto the grass, careful not to cross over the graves. Partly, because it seemed pretty rude to stomp all over someone&#x2019;s remains . . . particularly someone you hadn&#x2019;t even known. And partly, Vlad gulped, because he&#x2019;d seen too many movies where the dead would come back to life.</div><div class="tx">They were just movies, and Vlad knew that. Pure fiction. But nevertheless, he couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to cross over the graves, for fear someone . . . or something . . . would rip through the earth and latch onto his ankle.</div><div class="tx">He took slow, tentative steps toward the tree, sweeping the stones with his eyes.

At the very bottom was a simple inscription, one that Nelly was brave enough to choose for the stone when Vlad had not been: WE&#x2019;LL MISS YOU<i>.</i></div><div class="tx">Vlad knelt before the stone, stretching his hand out to brush away the dead leaves and dirt that had accumulated over the past year.</div><div class="tx"> He dropped his gaze to the ground and tried hard not to think about the last time he saw them, or the fact that their bodies were lying several feet below in the cold, hallowed ground.

He ran a caring hand over the top of their stone and let the tears come. They rolled down his cheeks in streams. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m sorry I turned off your alarm.

A strand of tissue shot across the diameter of the hole, followed by another. And another. Forming a strange web of flesh&#x2014;accompanied by the now deafening spider sounds.

It hadn&#x2019;t worked&#x2014; the fans just whirred loudly, giving everyone headaches and messing up their hair without really cooling them off. And nothing is more unpleasant than a few hundred teenagers forced to study algebraic equations while sweat beads on their skin.</div><div class="tx">Vlad hadn&#x2019;t felt much like talking since he left the hospital. Henry had asked repeatedly for the details of Joss&#x2019;s attack&#x2014;always on the heels of apologizing for his cousin&#x2019;s actions&#x2014;but Vlad wasn&#x2019;t feeling up to sharing just yet.

The homework he&#x2019;d caught up on, though, so apparently his grades weren&#x2019;t as bad as they could have been. Right now, though, he was looking forward to summer vacation.</div><div class="tx">Vlad turned his head and looked at Joss&#x2019;s locker, now empty. He hadn&#x2019;t seen Joss since that day in the hospital. By the time he got home, Joss had split town, thankfully without revealing Vlad&#x2019;s secret to anyone. As far as Vlad knew, he hadn&#x2019;t even mentioned it to Henry. Joss might be an attempted murderer and the worst kind of backstabber imaginable, but at least he was a man of his word.</div><div class="tx">Henry squeezed Vlad&#x2019;s shoulder.

Vlad watched him without interest. Eddie Poe passed by and offered Vlad a glare&#x2014;apparently near-death experiences aren&#x2019;t enough to get the media off of your back. The Eddie situation was something he&#x2019;d have to deal with eventually, but for now, just knowing Joss wasn&#x2019;t around to hurt him anymore was enough. More than anything, Vlad just wanted his freshman year to be over. Not that he expected his sophomore year to be much better, especially if Eddie didn&#x2019;t get over his monster obsession . . . but hey, a guy can dream.</div></body></html>';
