His inaugural address reflects some similarities with the speech of another president trying to communicate hope in a time of crisis... Abraham Lincoln. Obama called \"for a new age\" in much the same way that Lincoln spoke of \"a new birth\" in his speech at Gettysburg. Obama further echoed Lincoln by saying \"all are equal, all are free\" and that \"men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough there are similarities between the two speeches, each speech is specific to its own time, place, and situation. In addition, quotations from speeches should not be read out of context. So read President Obama\u2019s complete inauguration speech to fully appreciate his unique message as he began his historic administration as the first African American President of the United States.",

If other scientists  questioned his work, he resented them. Sometimes, he tried to ruin their careers. This books presents a compelling portrait of Newton as a genius full of contradictions.

The action takes place on a nineteenth-century whaling ship in the Atlantic Ocean. The narrator, a sailor who calls himself Ishmael, joins the crew of the ship and sets out to sea. There, he discovers that the ship\u2019s captain, Ahab, is hardly interested in true whaling. He wants one thing: Moby Dick, the great white whale that destroyed Ahab\u2019s last ship and took his leg. Ahab is obsessed with catching the whale at any cost. Will the entire crew have to pay the price?\r\n\r\nThis is an adapted story. Although the text has been altered in some ways, the story is very similar to the original story.",

All the while he is working behind Othello\u2019s back to ruin his life. Why does Iago betray Othello? Is he jealous of Othello\u2019s success, prejudiced against his color and culture, or envious of the passion he shares with Desdemona? The reasons behind Iago\u2019s deceptions are never completely clear, but human nature provides a wealth of possible explanations. However, although Iago is clearly the villain in this drama, the other characters\u2019 specific weaknesses, such as vanity, pride, distrust, and insecurity make it possible for Iago to manipulate them. Read the play to find out how Iago tricks the other characters into helping him accomplish his goal of destroying Othello.  \r\n\r\nThis is an adapted drama. Although the text has been altered in some ways, the story is very similar to the original play.",

A very different man, Angel Clare, seems to offer her love and salvation, but Tess must choose whether to reveal her past or remain silent in the hope of a peaceful future.

It begins by assessing the impact of his rural, traditional childhood on his personality. Then, it describes his early years as a revolutionary leader and master strategist, including his private life and marriages. It explores his twenty-seven years in jail under apartheid, and reveals the inside stories of the white government's first secretive contacts with him. It also highlights Mandela's remarkable lack of bitterness and his commitment to reconciliation with the white minority after his release. Readers get a rare insight into Mandela's role both in the crucial negotiations period and during his term as South Africa's first black president. More than a biography, this guide critically examines Mandela's iconic status and his impact on the world stage.",

Calling himself Soldier X, he vividly brings to life his journey from ROTC training and the grueling trials of the elite Ranger School to the treacherous terrain of the Shah-e-Kot Valley in Afghanistan. There, while leading his men on a mission to root out the hardcore hold-outs of Osama bin Laden\u2019s forces, he confronts and kills an Al Qaeda fighter. On his return to the United States, he must face how the media has distorted public perception of the war as he seeks to make peace with the man he has become. Exum\u2019s story of his introduction to the horrors of war is a frightening and inspiring first-hand account of combat from a new generation.",

It was once the family home of Catherine Earnshaw and her brother Hindley. When they were children, their father brought home an orphaned boy named Heathcliff. Heathcliff and Catherine always loved each other, but Hindley hated Heathcliff. When Mr. Earnshaw died,  Hindley inherited the estate and began treating Heathcliff like a servant. When it was time for Catherine to marry, she chose social advancement over her love for the impoverished Heathcliffe. Hated by Hindley and rejected by Catherine, Heathcliff left his childhood home with bitterness in his heart. When he returns years later as a wealthy man, he brings the bitterness back with him, as well as the love he once felt for Catherine.  \r\n\r\nThis is an adapted story.
